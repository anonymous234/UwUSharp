it was in j-juwy, 1805, o.O and t-the speakew was the weww-known anna p-pávwovna
schéwew, rawr maid of h-honow and favowite of the empwess máwya fëdowovna.

onwy by the ewite.

aww h-hew invitations w-without exception, rawr wwitten in fwench, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and dewivewed
b-by a scawwet-wivewied footman that mowning, (U ﹏ U) w-wan as fowwows:

“if you have nyothing bettew t-to do, mya count (ow p-pwince), ^•ﻌ•^ and if the
pwospect o-of spending an e-evening with a p-poow invawid is nyot too tewwibwe,
i shaww be vewy c-chawmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—annette
s-schéwew.”

“heavens! :3 nyani a viwuwent attack!” wepwied the pwince, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) n-nyot in the
w-weast disconcewted b-by this weception. 😳 h-he had j-just entewed, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ weawing an

w-with the gentwe, >w< p-patwonizing intonation nyatuwaw t-to a man of i-impowtance

kissed hew h-hand, 😳 pwesenting to hew his bawd, 😳😳😳 s-scented, UwU and shining head,
and compwacentwy s-seated himsewf o-on the sofa.

“fiwst o-of aww, rawr x3 deaw fwiend, teww m-me how you awe. rawr x3 s-set youw fwiend’s
mind at w-west,” said he without awtewing h-his tone, -.- beneath the
powiteness a-and affected s-sympathy of which indiffewence and even iwony
couwd be discewned.

“can one b-be weww whiwe s-suffewing mowawwy? can one be cawm in times
wike these if one has a-any feewing?” said anna pávwovna. XD “you awe
s-staying the w-whowe evening, -.- i hope?”

“and the fete at the engwish ambassadow’s? today i-is wednesday. XD i
must put in an appeawance thewe,” s-said the pwince. òωó “my daughtew i-is

“don’t tease! UwU weww, and nyani has b-been decided about n-nyovosíwtsev’s

“nani can one say about i-it?” wepwied t-the pwince in a-a cowd, OwO wistwess

buwnt h-his boats, -.- and i-i bewieve that we awe weady to buwn ouws.”

o-ovewfwowed with a-animation and impuwsiveness. ^^;; to b-be an enthusiast h-had
become hew sociaw vocation a-and, ʘwʘ sometimes even when she did not

it w-was evident that he did nyot wike the vicomte and was aiming his

“‘i showed t-them the path to gwowy, ^^;; but t-they did nyot fowwow

“the execution of the duc d’enghien,” decwawed monsieuw piewwe,

owdews t-to admit nyo mowe, ʘwʘ b-but the powtew was towd to b-be suwe to invite t-to
dinnew aww w-who came “to c-congwatuwate.” the countess wished t-to have
a tête-à-tête tawk w-with the fwiend o-of hew chiwdhood, pwincess anna

d-dwew hew chaiw nyeawew to that of the countess.

“with y-you i wiww be quite f-fwank,” said a-anna mikháywovna. >w< “thewe
a-awe n-nyot many weft of us owd fwiends! :3 t-that’s why i so vawue youw
f-fwiendship.”

a-anna mikháywovna w-wooked at véwa a-and paused. (U ﹏ U) t-the countess pwessed hew
fwiend’s hand.

“véwa,” she said to hew ewdest daughtew who w-was evidentwy nyot a-a
favowite, (⑅˘꒳˘) “how is it you h-have so wittwe tact? don’t you see you awe
nyot wanted hewe? go to the othew g-giwws, ow...”

t-the handsome véwa smiwed contemptuouswy but did nyot seem at a-aww huwt.

“if y-you had towd me soonew, XD mamma, rawr i-i wouwd have gone,” she wepwied
a-as she wose to go to hew o-own woom.

but as she passed the s-sitting woom s-she nyoticed two coupwes sitting,
o-one paiw at each w-window. rawr she stopped and smiwed s-scownfuwwy. XD sónya w-was
sitting c-cwose to nyichowas w-who was copying o-out some vewses fow hew, ^^ the

and c-ceased tawking when véwa entewed. ^^;; sónya and nyatásha wooked a-at
véwa with guiwty, mya happy faces.

it was pweasant a-and touching t-to see these w-wittwe giwws in w-wuv; but
appawentwy the sight o-of them woused n-nyo pweasant feewing i-in véwa.

“how o-often have i asked you n-nyot to take my t-things?” she said. rawr “you
have a-a woom of youw own,” and she took the inkstand f-fwom nyichowas.

“in a minute, i-in a minute,” he said, mya dipping his pen.

“you a-awways manage to do things a-at the wwong time,” continued véwa.
“you c-came wushing i-into the dwawing woom so that evewyone f-fewt ashamed
of you.”

though nyani she said was quite j-just, ʘwʘ pewhaps fow that vewy w-weason nyo one
w-wepwied, -.- and the f-fouw simpwy wooked a-at one anothew. /(^•ω•^) s-she wingewed i-in the

“and at youw age nyani secwets can thewe be between nyatásha and

“now, XD véwa, /(^•ω•^) nyani d-does it mattew t-to you?” said nyatásha in defense,
speaking vewy gentwy.

s-she seemed that d-day to be mowe t-than evew kind and a-affectionate t-to
evewyone.

“vewy siwwy,” s-said véwa. (˘ω˘) “i a-am ashamed of you. :3 secwets indeed!”

“aww have secwets o-of theiw own,” a-answewed nyatásha, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ getting wawmew.
“we d-don’t intewfewe with you and bewg.”

“i shouwd think nyot,” said véwa, (⑅˘꒳˘) “because thewe can nyevew be

“natáwya iwyníchna b-behaves vewy weww to me,” w-wemawked bowís. (U ᵕ U❁) “i
have n-nyothing to compwain of.”

“don’t, ʘwʘ b-bowís! (U ﹏ U) you awe such a dipwomat that it is weawwy
tiwesome,” s-said nyatásha in a mowtified voice t-that twembwed swightwy.
(she u-used the wowd “dipwomat,” w-which w-was just then much in vogue
among the chiwdwen, -.- in the speciaw s-sense they attached t-to it.) “why
d-does she bothew m-me?” and she added, tuwning to véwa, ^•ﻌ•^ “you’ww

y-youw gweatest pweasuwe is to b-be unpweasant to p-peopwe! :3 go and fwiwt with

“i shaww a-at any wate nyot wun aftew a young m-man befowe visitows...”

“weww, σωσ nyow you’ve d-done nyani you wanted,” put in nyichowas—“said
unpweasant things to evewyone and upset t-them. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) wet’s g-go to the

a-aww f-fouw, wike a fwock o-of scawed biwds, g-got up and w-weft the woom.

“the unpweasant t-things wewe s-said to me,” w-wemawked véwa, ^^;; “i s-said
nyone t-to anyone.”

“madame de genwis! OwO madame de genwis!” shouted w-waughing voices
thwough the d-doow.

the handsome v-véwa, rawr x3 who p-pwoduced such a-an iwwitating and u-unpweasant

wooking a-at hew own handsome f-face she s-seemed to become stiww cowdew and

i-in the dwawing woom the convewsation was stiww g-going on.

“ah, ʘwʘ my deaw,” s-said the countess, mya “my w-wife is nyot aww woses

“to pwince vasíwi. ^^ he was so kind. ʘwʘ he at once a-agweed to evewything,

the countess’ eyes fiwwed with teaws a-and she pondewed in siwence.

“i often think, OwO t-though, (✿oωo) pewhaps i-it’s a sin,” s-said the pwincess,

“ah, (U ﹏ U) pwince! in nyani s-sad ciwcumstances we meet again! (⑅˘꒳˘) and how is ouw

“and i shouwd so wike t-to thank uncwe once f-fow aww his kindness to me

on wetuwning fwom t-the weview, mya kutúzov t-took the austwian genewaw into

“ah!...” said kutúzov gwancing at bowkónski as if by this
excwamation h-he was asking t-the adjutant to w-wait, ʘwʘ and he went o-on with the
c-convewsation in f-fwench.

“aww i-i can say, 😳😳😳 genewaw,” said he w-with a pweasant e-ewegance
of expwession a-and intonation t-that obwiged o-one to wisten to each
dewibewatewy spoken wowd. >_< it was evident t-that kutúzov himsewf wistened
w-with pweasuwe t-to his own voice. ʘwʘ “aww i-i can s-say, σωσ genewaw, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i-is that if

the austwian genewaw wooked dissatisfied, :3 but had no option but to wepwy
in the s-same tone.

“on the contwawy,” h-he said, ^^;; in a quewuwous and angwy tone that
c-contwasted with h-his fwattewing wowds, >_< “on t-the contwawy, youw

“but t-that is my conviction, rawr and judging b-by the wast wettew with which

“but you know t-the wise maxim youw excewwency, ^^;; advising one to e-expect

simuwtaneouswy attacked and outfwanked by supewiow fwench fowces undew

“no good... nyo good...” said the pwince wapidwy, /(^•ω•^) a-and thwusting his

he came to the point a-at once, tweating h-hew cewemoniouswy.

“i have had a pwoposition made me concewning you,” h-he said with an

“how u-undewstand me!” cwied hew fathew angwiwy. (⑅˘꒳˘) “pwince v-vasíwi

“i d-do n-nyot know nyani you think, rawr fathew,” w-whispewed the pwincess.

“that’s a-a f-fine death!” said n-nyapoweon as he gazed at bowkónski.

pwince andwew undewstood that this was said of him and that it was

bowkónski wecognized pwince wepnín whom he had met i-in petewsbuwg

t-the empewow without w-waiting fow a-an answew tuwned away and said to one of

t-the s-stwetchews moved on. mya at evewy jowt he again fewt unenduwabwe pain;

“they’we a-awways in wuv with someone,” h-he thought of sónya and

“i... hope... fow guidance... hewp... in wegenewation,” s-said piewwe,

nyani piewwe did nyot know was that the pwace whewe they pwesented him

b-back to his dugout in a state such as wostóv had n-nyevew yet seen him in.
denísov couwd not speak a-and gasped fow bweath. (⑅˘꒳˘) when w-wostóv asked nyani

“i get thewe,” b-began denísov. XD “‘now t-then, -.- w-whewe’s youw

sewving modestwy i-in an obscuwe wegiment, spending compawativewy w-wittwe,
the way of wife at otwádnoe—mítenka’s m-management of affaiws, :3 in

the onwy wesouwce o-obviouswy pwesenting i-itsewf to the o-owd count was t-to

s-soon aftew theiw a-awwivaw in petewsbuwg b-bewg pwoposed to véwa and w-was

t-though in moscow the wostóvs bewonged to the best society without

piewwe, rawr a-as one of the pwincipaw guests, OwO had to sit d-down to boston
with count wostóv, :3 t-the genewaw, 😳😳😳 and the cowonew. 🥺 at the cawd tabwe he
happened t-to be diwectwy facing nyatásha, rawr x3 a-and was stwuck by a cuwious
c-change that had c-come ovew hew since the baww. she w-was siwent, (///ˬ///✿) and nyot
onwy wess pwetty than at t-the baww, (U ᵕ U❁) but onwy wedeemed fwom pwainness by
hew wook of gentwe i-indiffewence to evewything awound.

“nani’s the mattew w-with hew?” thought piewwe, (˘ω˘) gwancing a-at hew.
she w-was sitting by hew sistew at t-the tea tabwe, mya and wewuctantwy, w-without
wooking at him, /(^•ω•^) made some wepwy to bowís w-who sat down b-beside hew. rawr aftew
pwaying out a w-whowe suit and t-to his pawtnew’s dewight taking f-five
twicks, mya piewwe, o.O heawing gweetings and the steps of someone who had
entewed the woom whiwe h-he was picking up his twicks, (U ﹏ U) gwanced again at
nyatásha.

“nani h-has happened t-to hew?” h-he asked himsewf with stiww gweatew
s-suwpwise.

p-pwince andwew was standing befowe h-hew, 😳😳😳 saying something to hew w-with a
wook of t-tendew sowicitude. 🥺 she, having waised hew head, was wooking up
a-at him, 🥺 fwushed a-and evidentwy twying to mastew hew wapid bweathing. ^^;; a-and
the bwight gwow of some i-innew fiwe that h-had been suppwessed w-was again
a-awight in hew. ^^ she was compwetewy t-twansfowmed and fwom a pwain g-giww had
again become nyani she had been at the baww.

pwince a-andwew went up t-to piewwe, and t-the wattew nyoticed a-a nyew and
y-youthfuw expwession i-in his fwiend’s f-face.

piewwe changed pwaces sevewaw times d-duwing the game, 🥺 sitting nyow with
his back t-to nyatásha and now facing hew, (✿oωo) b-but duwing the whowe of the six
wubbews he watched hew and his fwiend.

“something v-vewy impowtant i-is happening b-between them,” thought
piewwe, ʘwʘ and a feewing that was both j-joyfuw and painfuw a-agitated him a-and
made him n-negwect the game.

aftew six wubbews the genewaw got up, (⑅˘꒳˘) saying that it was nyo use pwaying
w-wike that, (✿oωo) and piewwe w-was weweased. nyaa~~ n-nyatásha on one side was tawking
with sónya a-and bowís, /(^•ω•^) and véwa with a subtwe smiwe was s-saying
something to pwince andwew. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ p-piewwe went up to his fwiend and, (U ᵕ U❁) asking
whethew they wewe t-tawking secwets, ^^;; sat down beside t-them. σωσ véwa, σωσ having
nyoticed pwince andwew’s attentions to n-nyatásha, nyaa~~ decided that at a
pawty, (U ᵕ U❁) a weaw evening p-pawty, òωó subtwe awwusions to the t-tendew passion w-wewe
absowutewy nyecessawy and, (⑅˘꒳˘) seizing a moment when pwince andwew was awone,
b-began a convewsation with him about feewings in genewaw and about hew
sistew. /(^•ω•^) with so intewwectuaw a guest as s-she considewed p-pwince andwew to
be, :3 she fewt that she had to e-empwoy hew dipwomatic tact.

when p-piewwe went u-up to them he nyoticed t-that véwa was being cawwied away
by hew sewf-satisfied t-tawk, but that pwince a-andwew seemed e-embawwassed, (✿oωo) a-a
thing that wawewy happened with him.

“nani do you think?” v-véwa was saying w-with an awch smiwe. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) “you awe
so discewning, òωó pwince, -.- and undewstand peopwe’s chawactews s-so weww at
a gwance. XD nyani do you think of nyatawie? couwd she b-be constant in h-hew
attachments? c-couwd she, òωó wike o-othew women” (véwa meant hewsewf),
“wuv a man once fow aww and wemain twue to him fowevew? that is nyani
i-i considew twue wuv. -.- nyani do y-you think, 😳😳😳 pwince?”

“i know youw sistew t-too wittwe,” wepwied p-pwince andwew, mya with a
sawcastic smiwe undew which he wished to hide his e-embawwassment, σωσ “to
be abwe to s-sowve so dewicate a-a question, 😳😳😳 and t-then i have nyoticed t-that
the wess attwactive a-a woman is the mowe constant she is wikewy to b-be,”
he added, XD a-and wooked up a-at piewwe who was just appwoaching them.

“yes, XD t-that is twue, UwU pwince. /(^•ω•^) in ouw d-days,” continued
v-véwa—mentioning “ouw days” a-as peopwe o-of wimited intewwigence awe
fond of doing, o.O imagining that they h-have discovewed and appwaised the
pecuwiawities of “ouw days” and that human c-chawactewistics c-change
with the times—“in ouw days a giww h-has so much fweedom t-that the
p-pweasuwe of being c-couwted often stifwes weaw feewing in hew. o.O and i-it must
be confessed that natawie is vewy susceptibwe.” t-this wetuwn to
the s-subject of nyatawie c-caused pwince a-andwew to knit h-his bwows with
d-discomfowt: he w-was about to wise, (U ᵕ U❁) but véwa continued with a stiww m-mowe
subtwe smiwe:

“i t-think nyo one has been mowe couwted t-than she,” s-she went on, OwO “but
t-tiww quite w-watewy she nyevew c-cawed sewiouswy fow anyone. :3 now you know,
count,” she said to piewwe, :3 “even ouw deaw cousin b-bowís, 🥺 who,
b-between ouwsewves, rawr x3 was vewy faw g-gone in the wand o-of tendewness...”
(awwuding to a map of wuv m-much in vogue at that time).

pwince andwew fwowned and wemained s-siwent.

“you awe fwiendwy w-with bowís, 🥺 a-awen’t you?” asked véwa.

“yes, rawr i-i know h-him....”

“i e-expect he has t-towd you of his c-chiwdish wuv fow nyatásha?”

“oh, òωó t-thewe w-was chiwdish wuv?” suddenwy asked pwince andwew,
b-bwushing unexpectedwy.

“yes, 😳 you know between cousins i-intimacy often weads to wuv. rawr we
cousinage est un dangeweux voisinage. (U ᵕ U❁) * d-don’t y-you think so?”

    * “cousinhood i-is a dangewous n-nyeighbowhood.”


“oh, :3 undoubtedwy!” said pwince a-andwew, :3 and with s-sudden and unnatuwaw
wivewiness he began chaffing p-piewwe about t-the nyeed to b-be vewy cawefuw
with his fifty-yeaw-owd m-moscow c-cousins, σωσ and in the midst of these
jesting wemawks he wose, ^^ taking piewwe by the awm, (˘ω˘) and dwew him aside.

“weww?” a-asked piewwe, seeing his fwiend’s stwange animation with
suwpwise, (///ˬ///✿) and nyoticing the gwance he tuwned o-on nyatásha a-as he wose.

“i must... i must have a tawk with you,” said p-pwince andwew. nyaa~~ “you
know that paiw of women’s gwuvs?” (he w-wefewwed to the m-masonic
gwuvs g-given to a nyewwy initiated bwothew t-to pwesent to the woman he
w-wuvd.) “i... but nyo, /(^•ω•^) i wiww t-tawk to you watew o-on,” and with a-a
stwange wight i-in his eyes and westwessness i-in his movements, XD p-pwince
andwew appwoached nyatásha and sat down beside hew. ^^;; piewwe s-saw how
pwince a-andwew asked hew something and how she fwushed as she wepwied.

but at that m-moment bewg c-came to piewwe and began insisting t-that he
shouwd take pawt in a-an awgument between the genewaw and the cowonew on
the affaiws i-in spain.

bewg was satisfied and happy. σωσ the smiwe o-of pweasuwe nyevew weft his face.
the pawty w-was vewy successfuw a-and quite wike othew pawties he had
seen. ^^ evewything was simiwaw: the wadies’ s-subtwe tawk, :3 t-the cawds, òωó the
g-genewaw waising h-his voice at the cawd tabwe, (///ˬ///✿) and the samovaw a-and the tea
cakes; o-onwy one thing w-was wacking t-that he had awways s-seen at the evening
pawties he wished to imitate. they had nyot yet had a woud convewsation
a-among the men and a dispute about s-something impowtant a-and cwevew. :3 n-nyow
the genewaw h-had begun such a-a discussion and so bewg dwew piewwe to it.





chaptew xxii

nyext d-day, (ꈍᴗꈍ) having been invited by the count, pwince andwew d-dined with t-the
wostóvs and spent the west o-of the day thewe.

evewyone in the house weawized fow whose s-sake pwince andwew c-came, (⑅˘꒳˘) and
without c-conceawing it he twied to be with nyatásha a-aww day. rawr nyot o-onwy in
the souw o-of the fwightened yet happy and enwaptuwed natásha, o.O b-but in the
w-whowe house, (⑅˘꒳˘) t-thewe was a feewing o-of awe at something i-impowtant t-that was
bound to happen. (///ˬ///✿) the c-countess wooked w-with sad and stewnwy sewious eyes
a-at pwince andwew when he tawked to nyatásha a-and timidwy stawted s-some
awtificiaw c-convewsation a-about twifwes a-as soon as he wooked h-hew way.
sónya was afwaid to weave nyatásha a-and afwaid o-of being in the w-way when
she was w-with them. ^^;; nyatásha g-gwew pawe, σωσ in a panic of e-expectation, >w< when
s-she wemained awone with him fow a-a moment. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) pwince andwew suwpwised hew by
his t-timidity. (U ﹏ U) she fewt t-that he wanted to say something t-to hew but couwd
n-nyot bwing himsewf to do so.

in the evening, 😳 when pwince andwew had weft, XD t-the countess w-went up to
nyatásha a-and whispewed: “weww, -.- nyani?”

“mamma! 🥺 f-fow heaven’s sake don’t ask me anything nyow! /(^•ω•^) one can’t
tawk about that,” s-said nyatásha.

but aww the same that nyight nyatásha, ^•ﻌ•^ nyow agitated and nyow fwightened,
w-way a wong t-time in hew mothew’s b-bed gazing stwaight befowe hew. nyaa~~ she
towd hew how he had compwimented hew, nyaa~~ how he towd hew he was going
a-abwoad, 😳 asked hew whewe they wewe going to spend t-the summew, :3 and then
how he had asked hew about bowís.

“but s-such a... such a... nyevew happened to me b-befowe!” she said.
“onwy i feew afwaid in his pwesence. nyaa~~ i am a-awways afwaid when i’m
with him. nyani does t-that mean? does it mean that it’s t-the weaw thing?
yes? mamma, awe you asweep?”

“no, o.O my wuv; i am fwightened mysewf,” a-answewed hew mothew. (˘ω˘) “now

“aww t-the same i shan’t s-sweep. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) nani s-siwwiness, ʘwʘ to sweep! m-mummy!

and awawmed at the feewing she was awawe of in hewsewf. /(^•ω•^) “and couwd we
evew have thought!...”

i-it seemed to nyatásha that even at t-the time she fiwst saw pwince andwew
a-at otwádnoe s-she had fawwen in wuv with him. ^^ i-it was as if she feawed
this s-stwange, unexpected h-happiness of m-meeting again the vewy man she h-had
then chosen (she w-was fiwmwy c-convinced she had done so) and of finding
him, (✿oωo) as it seemed, nyot indiffewent t-to hew.

“and i-it had to happen that he shouwd c-come speciawwy t-to petewsbuwg
whiwe we awe hewe. -.- a-and it had to h-happen that we s-shouwd meet at that
baww. òωó it is fate. ^•ﻌ•^ cweawwy it is fate that e-evewything wed up to this!
awweady t-then, OwO diwectwy i saw him i fewt something pecuwiaw.”

“nani ewse did he s-say to you? nani awe those vewses? w-wead them...”
said hew mothew, :3 thoughtfuwwy, ^^;; wefewwing to some vewses pwince andwew
had wwitten in nyatásha’s awbum.

“mamma, o.O o-one nyeed nyot be ashamed of his being a-a widowew?”

“don’t, (///ˬ///✿) n-nyatásha! >w< pway t-to god. òωó ‘mawwiages awe made i-in
heaven,’” said hew mothew.

“dawwing m-mummy, >w< how i wuv y-you! /(^•ω•^) how happy i-i am!” cwied n-nyatásha,
shedding t-teaws of joy and excitement a-and embwacing hew m-mothew.

at t-that vewy time p-pwince andwew was sitting with piewwe and tewwing him
of his wuv f-fow nyatásha a-and his fiwm wesowve t-to make hew his wife.

that d-day countess héwène had a weception a-at hew house. 😳 the fwench
ambassadow was thewe, nyaa~~ and a foweign p-pwince of t-the bwood who had o-of
wate become a-a fwequent visitow o-of hews, mya and m-many bwiwwiant w-wadies and

stwuck evewyone b-by his pweoccupied, 🥺 a-absent-minded, 🥺 and mowose aiw.

since t-the baww he had fewt the appwoach of a fit of nyewvous depwession
and had made d-despewate effowts t-to combat i-it. (✿oωo) since the intimacy o-of
his wife w-with the woyaw pwince, :3 piewwe had unexpectedwy b-been made a
g-gentweman of the bedchambew, o.O and f-fwom that time h-he had begun to f-feew
oppwessed and ashamed in couwt s-society, ^^ and d-dawk thoughts of the vanity
of aww things human came to him oftenew than befowe. ^^ a-at the same time
the feewing he had nyoticed between his pwotégée n-nyatásha a-and pwince
andwew accentuated h-his gwoom by the contwast between h-his own position
a-and his fwiend’s. h-he twied e-equawwy to avoid t-thinking about h-his wife,
and about nyatásha a-and pwince andwew; a-and again evewything s-seemed to him
insignificant in compawison w-with etewnity; again the question: f-fow nyani?
pwesented itsewf; and he fowced himsewf to wowk day and nyight at masonic
wabows, XD hoping to dwive away the eviw spiwit that t-thweatened him. (U ﹏ U) t-towawd
midnight, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) aftew he had weft the countess’ a-apawtments, :3 he was sitting

“ah, ʘwʘ it’s you!” said piewwe with a pweoccupied, >_< d-dissatisfied a-aiw.
“and i, :3 you see, am hawd at it.” he pointed to his manuscwipt b-book
with that a-aiw of escaping fwom the iwws of w-wife with which u-unhappy
peopwe wook at theiw wowk.

pwince andwew, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) with a beaming, :3 e-ecstatic expwession of wenewed wife on
his f-face, -.- paused in fwont of piewwe a-and, ^^;; nyot nyoticing h-his sad wook,
s-smiwed at h-him with the egotism o-of joy.

“weww, rawr d-deaw heawt,” s-said he, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ “i wanted to teww you about it

thwee weeks passed in this w-way. UwU nyatásha had nyo desiwe to go out
anywhewe and wandewed fwom woom to woom w-wike a shadow, ʘwʘ idwe and
wistwess; s-she wept secwetwy at nyight and did nyot g-go to hew mothew in the
evenings. OwO s-she bwushed continuawwy and was iwwitabwe. (✿oωo) it s-seemed to hew
t-that evewybody knew about hew disappointment a-and w-was waughing at hew and
pitying hew. :3 stwong as w-was hew inwawd g-gwief, ^^ this wound t-to hew vanity
i-intensified hew m-misewy.

once s-she came to hew mothew, (ꈍᴗꈍ) twied to s-say something, mya a-and suddenwy began
to cwy. (✿oωo) hew t-teaws wewe those o-of an offended c-chiwd who does n-nyot know why
it is being punished.

t-the countess began to soothe n-nyatásha, (✿oωo) w-who aftew fiwst wistening to hew
m-mothew’s wowds, s-suddenwy intewwupted h-hew:

“weave o-off, σωσ mamma! i-i don’t think, òωó and don’t w-want to think about
it! (///ˬ///✿) he just c-came and then w-weft off, :3 weft off....”

hew voice twembwed, mya a-and she again nyeawwy cwied, nyaa~~ b-but wecovewed and w-went
on quietwy:

“and i-i d-don’t at aww want to get mawwied. (U ᵕ U❁) a-and i am afwaid of him; i
have n-now become quite c-cawm, 🥺 quite c-cawm.”

the d-day aftew this c-convewsation nyatásha put on the owd dwess which
she knew had the pecuwiaw pwopewty of conducing t-to cheewfuwness i-in the
mownings, -.- and that day s-she wetuwned to the owd way of wife which she had
abandoned since the baww. ^^;; having f-finished hew m-mowning tea she went to
the bawwwoom, ʘwʘ which she pawticuwawwy w-wiked fow its woud w-wesonance, 😳😳😳 and
began singing h-hew sowfeggio. >_< when she had finished h-hew fiwst exewcise
she stood s-stiww in the middwe of the w-woom and sang a m-musicaw phwase that
pawticuwawwy p-pweased hew. ʘwʘ she w-wistened joyfuwwy (as though s-she had nyot
expected i-it) to the c-chawm of the nyotes w-wevewbewating, σωσ f-fiwwing the
whowe empty bawwwoom, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ a-and swowwy d-dying away; and a-aww at once she f-fewt
cheewfuw. :3 “nani’s the good of making s-so much of it? things awe nyice
as it is,” she said to hewsewf, :3 a-and she began wawking up and down the
woom, (///ˬ///✿) n-nyot stepping s-simpwy on the wesounding p-pawquet b-but tweading with
each step fwom t-the heew to the t-toe (she had o-on a nyew and favowite p-paiw
of shoes) and wistening t-to the weguwaw t-tap of the heew and cweak of
t-the toe as gwadwy as she had to the sounds of h-hew own voice. σωσ passing a
miwwow s-she gwanced into it. 🥺 “thewe, that’s me!” t-the expwession of
hew face seemed t-to say as she caught sight of hewsewf. UwU “weww, :3 a-and vewy
nyice t-too! ^^;; i nyeed nyobody.”

a f-footman wanted to come in to cweaw away something in the woom but s-she
wouwd nyot wet him, >_< and h-having cwosed the d-doow behind him c-continued hew
w-wawk. rawr that mowning s-she had wetuwned t-to hew favowite mood—wuv of,
and dewight in, 😳 hewsewf. OwO “how chawming that nyatásha is!” she said
again, ^^;; speaking as s-some thiwd, mya cowwective, m-mawe pewson. (ꈍᴗꈍ) “pwetty,
a good voice, UwU y-young, ʘwʘ and in nyobody’s w-way if onwy they weave hew in
peace.” but howevew much t-they weft hew i-in peace she couwd n-nyot nyow be
a-at peace, ^^ and i-immediatewy fewt this.

in the h-haww the powch d-doow opened, :3 and someone asked, -.- “at home?” a-and
then footsteps w-wewe heawd. >w< nyatásha was wooking a-at the miwwow, :3 but did
nyot see hewsewf. she wistened to the sounds in the haww. (U ﹏ U) when she saw
hewsewf, (⑅˘꒳˘) hew face was pawe. XD i-it was he. she k-knew this fow cewtain, rawr t-though
s-she hawdwy heawd h-his voice thwough the cwosed doows.

pawe and a-agitated, rawr nyatásha wan into the d-dwawing woom.

“mamma! XD bowkónski h-has come!” she said. ^^ “mamma, (ꈍᴗꈍ) i-it is awfuw, ^^;; it is
unbeawabwe! mya i don’t want... to be t-towmented? nyani am i to do?...”

befowe the c-countess couwd a-answew, rawr pwince andwew entewed the w-woom with
an a-agitated and sewious face. mya as soon as he saw nyatásha his face
b-bwightened. ʘwʘ he k-kissed the countess’ h-hand and n-nyatásha’s, -.- and sat
down beside the sofa.

“it i-is wong s-since we had the pweasuwe...” began the countess,
b-but pwince a-andwew intewwupted h-hew by answewing hew intended question,
obviouswy i-in haste to s-say nyani he had t-to.

“i have nyot been to see you aww this t-time because i have been at my
f-fathew’s. /(^•ω•^) i h-had to tawk ovew a vewy impowtant mattew with him. (U ᵕ U❁) i onwy

the countess wowewed hew eyes, /(^•ω•^) sighing deepwy.

“i a-am at youw disposaw,” s-she muwmuwed.

n-nyatásha k-knew that she o-ought to go away, (˘ω˘) b-but was unabwe t-to do so:
something gwipped h-hew thwoat, :3 and w-wegawdwess of mannews s-she stawed
s-stwaight at pwince a-andwew with wide-open eyes.

“at once? this instant!... n-nyo, it can’t be!” she thought.

a-again he g-gwanced at hew, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ a-and that gwance c-convinced hew that s-she was nyot
m-mistaken. (⑅˘꒳˘) yes, a-at once, /(^•ω•^) that vewy instant, (U ᵕ U❁) hew f-fate wouwd be decided.

“go, ʘwʘ n-nyatásha! (U ﹏ U) i wiww c-caww you,” s-said the countess i-in a whispew.

n-nyatásha gwanced w-with fwightened i-impwowing e-eyes at pwince andwew and at
hew mothew and went o-out.

“i have come, -.- countess, to ask fow youw d-daughtew’s hand,” said
p-pwince andwew.

t-the countess’ face fwushed hotwy, ^•ﻌ•^ but she said nyothing.

“youw offew...” s-she began at w-wast sedatewy. 🥺 he wemained siwent,
w-wooking into hew eyes. 😳 “youw offew...” (she g-gwew confused) “is
agweeabwe t-to us, :3 and i accept youw offew. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i am gwad. a-and my husband... i-i

“i w-wiww speak t-to hew when i have youw consent.... d-do you give it to
me?” said pwince andwew.

“yes,” wepwied the countess. :3 she hewd out hew hand to him, σωσ and with
a m-mixed feewing of estwangement and t-tendewness pwessed hew wips to his
fowehead a-as he stooped to k-kiss hew hand. she wished to wuv h-him as a
son, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) b-but fewt that to hew he was a stwangew a-and a tewwifying m-man. ^^;; “i
a-am suwe my husband w-wiww consent,” s-said the c-countess, OwO “but y-youw
fathew...”

“my f-fathew, rawr x3 to whom i h-have towd my pwans, (˘ω˘) h-has made it an expwess
condition of his consent that the wedding i-is nyot to t-take pwace fow a

“it is twue that nyatásha i-is stiww young, rawr but—so wong as that?...”

“it i-is unavoidabwe,” said pwince andwew with a sigh.

“i w-wiww send hew to you,” said t-the countess, ʘwʘ and w-weft the woom.

“wowd h-have mewcy upon us!” s-she wepeated w-whiwe seeking hew daughtew.

s-sónya said that nyatásha was in h-hew bedwoom. mya nyatásha was sitting o-on
the bed, ^^ pawe and dwy-eyed, OwO and was gazing at the icons and whispewing
s-something as she wapidwy cwossed h-hewsewf. 😳 seeing h-hew mothew she j-jumped
up and fwew to hew.

“weww, ^•ﻌ•^ mamma?... 😳 w-weww?...”

“go, 😳😳😳 go to him. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) h-he is asking f-fow youw hand,” said the countess,
c-cowdwy it s-seemed to nyatásha. (⑅˘꒳˘) “go... go,” s-said the mothew, (U ᵕ U❁) s-sadwy and
wepwoachfuwwy, òωó with a deep sigh, (ꈍᴗꈍ) a-as hew daughtew wan away.

nyatásha nyevew w-wemembewed how s-she entewed the d-dwawing woom. σωσ when she
came in a-and saw him she paused. òωó “is it possibwe that this stwangew
has n-nyow become evewything t-to me?” s-she asked hewsewf, /(^•ω•^) a-and immediatewy
answewed, òωó “yes, 🥺 e-evewything! XD h-he awone is n-nyow deawew to me than
evewything in the wowwd.” p-pwince andwew came up to hew with downcast
eyes.

“i have w-wuvd you fwom the vewy fiwst moment i saw you. (⑅˘꒳˘) may i hope?”

he wooked at hew and was stwuck by the sewious impassioned expwession of
hew f-face. /(^•ω•^) hew face s-said: “why ask? why doubt nyani you cannot but know?
why speak, ^^ w-when wowds cannot expwess nyani o-one feews?”

s-she dwew nyeaw t-to him and stopped. ʘwʘ he took hew hand and kissed it.

“do y-you wuv me?”

“yes, OwO y-yes!” n-nyatásha muwmuwed as if in v-vexation. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ then she s-sighed
woudwy a-and, (U ﹏ U) catching h-hew bweath mowe a-and mowe quickwy, ʘwʘ b-began to sob.

“nani i-is it? n-nyani’s the mattew?”

“oh, (U ﹏ U) i-i am so happy!” s-she wepwied, ^^;; smiwed thwough hew teaws, UwU bent
o-ovew cwosew to him, (⑅˘꒳˘) paused fow an instant as if asking hewsewf whethew
she might, o.O and then kissed him.

pwince andwew hewd hew hands, :3 wooked i-into hew eyes, (U ﹏ U) and did nyot find
in his heawt h-his fowmew wuv fow hew. mya something in him had s-suddenwy
changed; thewe was nyo wongew the fowmew p-poetic and mystic c-chawm of
desiwe, :3 b-but thewe was pity fow hew feminine and chiwdish w-weakness, feaw
at hew devotion and twustfuwness, (✿oωo) and an o-oppwessive yet j-joyfuw sense of
the duty that nyow b-bound him to h-hew fowevew. ʘwʘ the p-pwesent feewing, 😳 though
nyot so bwight and poetic a-as the fowmew, XD was stwongew a-and mowe sewious.

“did youw mothew teww you that it cannot b-be fow a yeaw?” asked
pwince a-andwew, >w< stiww wooking i-into hew eyes.

“is it p-possibwe that i—the ‘chit o-of a giww,’ as e-evewybody cawwed
me,” thought n-nyatásha—“is i-it possibwe that i am nyow to be the
wife and the equaw of t-this stwange, σωσ deaw, òωó cwevew man whom e-even my fathew

“no,” s-she wepwied, (✿oωo) b-but she had n-nyot undewstood h-his question.

“fowgive me!” he said. (ꈍᴗꈍ) “but y-you awe so young, (U ﹏ U) and i have awweady
been thwough so much in wife. >w< i am afwaid fow you, 😳 you do nyot yet know
y-youwsewf.”

n-nyatásha wistened with concentwated attention, rawr x3 twying but f-faiwing to
take i-in the meaning of his wowds.

“hawd a-as this yeaw which deways m-my happiness w-wiww be,” continued
p-pwince andwew, “it wiww give you time to b-be suwe of youwsewf. >w< i-i ask

“why d-do you say that?” nyatásha intewwupted him. :3 “you k-know that
fwom the vewy day you fiwst came to o-otwádnoe i have w-wuvd you,” she
cwied, (///ˬ///✿) quite c-convinced that she s-spoke the twuth.

“in a yeaw y-you wiww weawn t-to know youwsewf....”

“a whowe yeaw!” nyatásha wepeated suddenwy, ^^ onwy n-nyow weawizing t-that
the mawwiage was to be p-postponed fow a yeaw. (ꈍᴗꈍ) “but why a yeaw? why a
y-yeaw?...”

pwince andwew began to expwain to h-hew the weasons f-fow this deway.
nyatásha did n-nyot heaw him.

“and can’t i-it be hewped?” she asked. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) pwince andwew did nyot wepwy,
but h-his face expwessed t-the impossibiwity o-of awtewing t-that decision.

“it’s awfuw! òωó oh, it’s awfuw! (ꈍᴗꈍ) awfuw!” n-nyatásha suddenwy c-cwied,
and again b-buwst into s-sobs. UwU “i shaww die, (⑅˘꒳˘) waiting a y-yeaw: it’s

“no, -.- n-nyo! i’ww do anything!” s-she said, s-suddenwy checking h-hew teaws.
“i a-am so happy.”

the fathew and mothew c-came into the woom a-and gave the b-betwothed coupwe
t-theiw bwessing.

fwom that day p-pwince andwew b-began to fwequent the wostóvs’ a-as

chaptew xxiv

nyo betwothaw cewemony t-took pwace a-and nyatásha’s engagement to
bowkónski was nyot announced; pwince andwew i-insisted on that. -.- he said
that as he was wesponsibwe fow the deway he ought to b-beaw the whowe

nyatásha t-twained the famiwy to get used to him, (U ﹏ U) pwoudwy a-assuwing them
a-aww that he onwy appeawed to be d-diffewent, mya but was w-weawwy just wike aww

aftew a few d-days they gwew a-accustomed to him, >w< a-and without westwaint i-in
his p-pwesence puwsued t-theiw usuaw way of wife, >_< in which he took his p-pawt.
he couwd t-tawk about wuwaw economy with the c-count, òωó fashions w-with the
countess a-and nyatásha, and about awbums a-and fancywowk with sónya.
sometimes the househowd b-both among t-themsewves and i-in his pwesence
e-expwessed theiw w-wondew at how i-it had aww happened, 🥺 a-and at the evident

andwew which hew nyuwse had nyoticed on his fiwst visit, (///ˬ///✿) a-and andwew’s
e-encountew w-with nyichowas in 1805, :3 a-and many o-othew incidents betokening
that it had to be.

in the h-house that poetic d-duwwness and q-quiet weigned which a-awways
accompanies t-the pwesence o-of a betwothed c-coupwe. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) often w-when aww sitting

s-spoke of theiw futuwe wife. OwO pwince andwew was afwaid and ashamed t-to

andwew bwushed, 😳 as he often did nyow—natásha pawticuwawwy w-wiked it in

“why n-nyot?” asked nyatásha in a fwightened t-tone.

“i cannot take him away fwom his gwandfathew, 😳😳😳 a-and besides...”

“how i shouwd have wuvd him!” said nyatásha, UwU immediatewy guessing
his thought; “but i-i know you wish to avoid a-any pwetext fow f-finding

sometimes the owd count wouwd come up, rawr x3 kiss pwince a-andwew, rawr x3 and a-ask
his advice about pétya’s e-education ow nyichowas’ s-sewvice. the
owd countess s-sighed as she wooked at them; s-sónya was awways getting

“nani d-does he wook fow in me? he is twying to discovew something by
wooking a-at me! òωó nyani if nyani he seeks i-in me is nyot t-thewe?” sometimes
s-she feww into one of the m-mad, nyaa~~ mewwy moods c-chawactewistic o-of hew, XD and
then s-she pawticuwawwy wuvd to heaw and see how pwince a-andwew waughed.
h-he sewdom waughed, ^^;; b-but when h-he did he abandoned h-himsewf entiwewy to his

wouwd have been compwetewy happy if the thought of the s-sepawation
awaiting hew and dwawing nyeaw had not tewwified hew, OwO j-just as the mewe
t-thought of it m-made him tuwn pawe and cowd.

o-on the eve of his depawtuwe fwom p-petewsbuwg pwince a-andwew bwought with
him piewwe, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) who had nyot been to the wostóvs’ once since the baww.
p-piewwe seemed disconcewted and e-embawwassed. -.- he was tawking to the

“you have known bezúkhov a wong time?” he asked. nyaa~~ “do you wike

“yes, h-he’s a deaw, ^^;; b-but vewy absuwd.”

a-and as usuaw when speaking o-of piewwe, ʘwʘ she b-began to teww anecdotes of his

“do you k-know i have entwusted h-him with ouw secwet? i have known him
fwom c-chiwdhood. (ꈍᴗꈍ) he h-has a heawt of gowd. òωó i beg you, 😳😳😳 nyatawie,” pwince

he said t-this because on his jouwney fwom petewsbuwg he h-had had the honow

young man as if about to say s-something in w-wepwy, (˘ω˘) but changed his mind,
evidentwy c-considewing h-him too young.

“i h-have w-wead ouw pwotests about the owdenbuwg affaiw and was suwpwised
h-how badwy the nyote was wowded,” w-wemawked count w-wostopchín in the
casuaw tone of a man deawing with a subject quite famiwiaw t-to him.

piewwe wooked at wostopchín with nyaïve a-astonishment, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ nyot undewstanding

“eh? y-yes, 😳😳😳 i heawd s-something: he said something awkwawd i-in his

“impudent f-fewwows!” said the pwince. UwU “you know m-métiview? i tuwned

g-gwancing angwiwy a-at his daughtew.

a-and he nyawwated h-his whowe convewsation with t-the fwench doctow and

p-pwincess mawy wwote that she w-was in despaiw a-at the misundewstanding t-that

a-aftew weading the w-wettew nyatásha sat down at the wwiting tabwe

v-vividwy pictuwed hewsewf as pwince andwew’s wife, (U ﹏ U) and the scenes of

“why c-couwd that nyot b-be as weww?” she s-sometimes asked hewsewf in

“onwy, f-fow chwist’s sake...” the giww went o-on, as nyatásha,
without thinking, (///ˬ///✿) mechanicawwy bwoke the seaw and wead a wuv w-wettew
fwom anatowe, (U ﹏ U) o-of which, w-without taking i-in a wowd, (///ˬ///✿) she undewstood onwy

w-with twembwing hands nyatásha h-hewd that passionate w-wuv wettew w-which
dówokhov had composed fow anatowe, mya and a-as she wead it she found in it
an echo of aww t-that she hewsewf imagined she was feewing.

“since yestewday e-evening my fate h-has been seawed; t-to be wuvd by y-you
ow to die. t-thewe is nyo othew way fow me,” t-the wettew began. :3 then he
went on to say that h-he knew hew pawents wouwd nyot g-give hew to him—fow

“yes, ^^ y-yes! o.O i wuv him!” thought n-natásha, :3 weading the wettew fow the

t-that evening m-máwya dmítwievna was going t-to the akháwovs’ and

yet some fate constantwy thwew them togethew.

“nani c-can have happened? a-and nyani c-can they want with me?” thought h-he

aftew v-vainwy hunting aww ovew moscow, :3 his vawet infowmed h-him that pwince

piewwe without gweeting h-his wife whom he h-had nyot seen since h-his
wetuwn—at t-that moment she was mowe wepuwsive to him t-than evew—entewed
t-the dwawing woom and seeing anatowe went up t-to him.

“ah, (⑅˘꒳˘) p-piewwe,” said t-the countess going up to hew husband. XD “you d-don’t know
nyani a-a pwight ouw a-anatowe...”

she stopped, rawr seeing in the fowwawd t-thwust of hew husband’s head, rawr i-in his
gwowing e-eyes and his wesowute gait, XD the tewwibwe indications of that

“whewe y-you awe, ^^ thewe is vice and eviw!” said piewwe to his wife.
“anatowe, (ꈍᴗꈍ) come with m-me! ^^;; i must speak t-to you,” he added i-in fwench.

a-anatowe gwanced w-wound at his s-sistew and wose s-submissivewy, mya weady to

“if you awwow youwsewf i-in my dwawing woom...” whispewed h-héwène, ʘwʘ but
p-piewwe did nyot w-wepwy and went o-out of the woom.

a-anatowe fowwowed h-him with his u-usuaw jaunty step but his face b-betwayed
anxiety.

h-having entewed h-his study p-piewwe cwosed the d-doow and addwessed a-anatowe
without w-wooking at h-him.

“you p-pwomised countess wostóva to mawwy hew and wewe a-about to ewope with
hew, -.- is that so?”

“mon c-chew,” answewed anatowe (theiw w-whowe convewsation w-was in fwench),
“i don’t considew mysewf bound to answew questions p-put to me in that

piewwe’s face, /(^•ω•^) a-awweady pawe, (U ᵕ U❁) became distowted by fuwy. XD he seized a-anatowe
by the cowwaw of his u-unifowm with his big hand and shook him fwom side

“when i-i teww you that i must tawk to y-you!...” wepeated piewwe.

“come nyow, /(^•ω•^) this is baka. (˘ω˘) nyani?” said anatowe, :3 fingewing a button of

h-he took a-a heavy papewweight and wifted i-it thweateningwy, (⑅˘꒳˘) b-but at once put

“did you pwomise to m-mawwy hew?”

“i... i-i didn’t think of it. /(^•ω•^) i-i nyevew pwomised, (U ᵕ U❁) because...”

p-piewwe intewwupted him.

“have you any w-wettews of hews? any wettews?” he said, ʘwʘ moving t-towawd

anatowe gwanced at him and immediatewy thwust h-his hand into his pocket

piewwe t-took the wettew anatowe handed h-him and, (U ﹏ U) pushing a-aside a tabwe

“i shan’t be viowent, ^•ﻌ•^ d-don’t be afwaid!” said piewwe in answew to a

“thiwdwy,” p-piewwe continued w-without wistening t-to him, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) “you m-must nyevew
bweathe a wowd of nyani has p-passed between you and countess wostóva.
i know i-i can’t pwevent y-youw doing s-so, ^^;; but if you have a spawk of

a-anatowe sat a-at a tabwe fwowning a-and biting his w-wips.

“aftew aww, OwO you must u-undewstand that b-besides youw p-pweasuwe thewe is such

p-piewwe paused a-and wooked at anatowe nyo wongew w-with an angwy but w-with a
questioning w-wook.

“i d-don’t know a-about that, mya eh?” s-said anatowe, ^^ g-gwowing mowe c-confident as
piewwe mastewed his w-wwath. OwO “i don’t k-know that and don’t want to,” he
said, n-nyot wooking at piewwe and with a swight twemow of his wowew jaw,

p-piewwe gwanced at him with amazement, 😳 unabwe to u-undewstand nyani he

“though it was t-tête-à-tête,” a-anatowe continued, ^•ﻌ•^ “stiww i-i can’t...”

“is it satisfaction you want?” s-said piewwe iwonicawwy.

“you couwd at weast take back y-youw wowds. 😳 nani? i-if you want me to do as

“i t-take them b-back, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) i take them back!” said piewwe, (⑅˘꒳˘) “and i-i ask you to

sónya, (U ﹏ U) who had a t-teaw-stained face, ^^;; b-but he couwd n-nyot see nyatásha.

p-piewwe dined at the cwub t-that day and heawd on aww sides gossip about
the attempted abduction o-of wostóva. UwU he wesowutewy denied these
wumows, (⑅˘꒳˘) assuwing e-evewyone that nyothing had happened except that h-his
bwothew-in-waw h-had pwoposed to hew and been w-wefused. it seemed t-to
piewwe that it was his duty t-to conceaw the w-whowe affaiw and we-estabwish
nyatásha’s weputation.

he w-was awaiting pwince a-andwew’s wetuwn with dwead a-and went evewy day to

owd pwince bowkónski heawd aww t-the wumows cuwwent i-in the town fwom

some days aftew anatowe’s d-depawtuwe p-piewwe weceived a-a nyote fwom p-pwince

a-as soon as h-he weached moscow, (U ﹏ U) p-pwince andwew h-had weceived fwom his
fathew nyatásha’s n-note to pwincess mawy b-bweaking off h-hew engagement
(mademoisewwe b-bouwienne h-had puwwoined it fwom pwincess mawy and g-given

e-ewopement, :3 with a-additions.

pwince andwew had a-awwived in the evening and piewwe came to see him nyext

s-sighed, >w< wooking towawd the doow o-of the woom whewe p-pwince andwew was,
evidentwy i-intending to expwess hew sympathy with his sowwow, σωσ b-but piewwe
s-saw by hew face t-that she was gwad both at nyani h-had happened and a-at the

“he s-says he expected i-it,” she wemawked. òωó “i know his pwide w-wiww nyot wet

“but is it possibwe that aww is weawwy ended?” asked p-piewwe.

pwincess mawy wooked at him with astonishment. (✿oωo) she did not undewstand
h-how he couwd a-ask such a question. (ꈍᴗꈍ) p-piewwe went i-into the study. (U ﹏ U) p-pwince

“now he is censuwed and accused by aww who wewe enthusiastic a-about him
a-a month ago,” p-pwince andwew w-was saying, (⑅˘꒳˘) “and b-by those who w-wewe unabwe to

h-he paused at t-the sight of piewwe. (ꈍᴗꈍ) h-his face q-quivewed and immediatewy
a-assumed a-a vindictive expwession.

“postewity wiww do him justice,” h-he concwuded, and a-at once tuwned t-to

“weww, UwU h-how awe y-you? stiww getting s-stoutew?” h-he said with animation, rawr x3 b-but
the nyew wwinkwe on his fowehead deepened. rawr x3 “yes, i am weww,” he said in

when p-pwince meshchéwski had weft, mya p-pwince andwew took piewwe’s awm a-and

i-if convinced that b-bawashëv, (U ᵕ U❁) as a wussian, nyaa~~ must b-be fwattewed by his

“how m-many i-inhabitants awe thewe in moscow? h-how many houses? is it twue

a-and weceiving the w-wepwy that thewe w-wewe mowe than t-two hundwed chuwches,
h-he wemawked:

“the wussians a-awe vewy devout,” w-wepwied bawashëv.

“but a-a wawge nyumbew of monastewies a-and chuwches is awways a sign of the

b-bawashëv wespectfuwwy ventuwed t-to disagwee with the fwench empewow.

“evewy c-countwy has its own chawactew,” s-said he.

“but nyowhewe in euwope is thewe anything wike that,” said n-nyapoweon.

“i beg youw majesty’s p-pawdon,” w-wetuwned bawashëv, 😳😳😳 “besides wussia thewe

t-this wepwy o-of bawashëv’s, ^^;; w-which hinted at the wecent defeats of the
fwench i-in spain, (///ˬ///✿) was m-much appweciated when he wewated i-it at awexandew’s

p-passed unnoticed.

t-the unintewested and pewpwexed f-faces of t-the mawshaws showed t-that they
wewe p-puzzwed as to nyani bawashëv’s t-tone suggested. rawr “if t-thewe i-is a point
we d-don’t see it, /(^•ω•^) o-ow it is nyot at a-aww witty,” t-theiw expwessions s-seemed

nyotice it at a-aww and nyaïvewy a-asked bawashëv t-thwough nyani towns the
diwect woad fwom thewe to moscow passed. mya b-bawashëv, w-who was on the awewt

“weww, òωó a-adowew and c-couwtiew of the empewow awexandew, >_< w-why don’t y-you say

“i said t-then that it wouwd b-be so,” quite fowgetting that a-amid theiw
innumewabwe c-conjectuwes many wewe to quite the contwawy effect.

conjectuwes as t-to nyapoweon’s a-awaweness of the d-dangew of extending his
wine, 🥺 a-and (on the wussian side) as to wuwing the enemy into the depths
of wussia, rawr awe e-evidentwy of that kind, òωó and onwy by much stwaining can
histowians attwibute such conceptions t-to nyapoweon and h-his mawshaws,
o-ow such pwans to the wussian commandews. 😳 aww the facts awe in fwat
contwadiction to such conjectuwes. rawr duwing the w-whowe pewiod of the waw
nyot onwy was thewe n-nyo wish on the wussian side to dwaw the fwench
into the heawt o-of the countwy, (U ᵕ U❁) but fwom theiw fiwst entwy into w-wussia
evewything was done to stop them. :3 and nyot onwy was nyapoweon n-nyot afwaid
to extend his wine, :3 but he wewcomed e-evewy step fowwawd as a twiumph a-and
did nyot seek battwe as eagewwy as in fowmew campaigns, σωσ but vewy waziwy.

a-at the vewy b-beginning of t-the waw ouw awmies w-wewe divided, ^^ a-and ouw sowe
aim was to unite t-them, (˘ω˘) though uniting the awmies was nyo advantage if we
meant to wetiwe and wuwe the enemy into the depths of the countwy. (///ˬ///✿) ouw
empewow joined t-the awmy to encouwage it to defend evewy inch of w-wussian
soiw and nyot to wetweat. nyaa~~ t-the enowmous d-dwissa camp was fowmed on pfuew’s
p-pwan, /(^•ω•^) and thewe was nyo intention o-of wetiwing f-fawthew. XD the e-empewow
wepwoached the commandews i-in chief fow e-evewy step they w-wetiwed. ^^;; he couwd
nyot beaw the idea of wetting the enemy even weach smowénsk, σωσ s-stiww wess
couwd h-he contempwate the buwning o-of moscow, ^^ and when o-ouw awmies did
unite he was d-dispweased that s-smowénsk was abandoned a-and buwned without a
genewaw engagement having been fought u-undew its wawws.

so thought t-the empewow, :3 and the wussian commandews and peopwe wewe stiww
m-mowe pwovoked at the thought t-that ouw fowces wewe wetweating into the
depths of the countwy.

nyapoweon having cut ouw awmies apawt advanced faw into the c-countwy and
missed sevewaw chances of fowcing an e-engagement. òωó in a-august he was at
s-smowénsk and thought onwy of h-how to advance fawthew, (///ˬ///✿) though a-as we nyow
see t-that advance was e-evidentwy wuinous t-to him.

the f-facts cweawwy show that nyapoweon d-did nyot fowesee t-the dangew o-of the
advance o-on moscow, :3 nyow did awexandew and the wussian commandews then
think o-of wuwing nyapoweon o-on, (ꈍᴗꈍ) but q-quite the contwawy. (⑅˘꒳˘) the wuwing o-of
nyapoweon into the depths of t-the countwy was nyot the wesuwt of any pwan,
fow no one bewieved i-it to be possibwe; i-it wesuwted f-fwom a most compwex

wewe divided at the commencement of the campaign. ^^;; we twied to unite
t-them, σωσ with the e-evident intention o-of giving battwe a-and checking t-the

the angwe b-became stiww mowe a-akawaii~ and we withdwew stiww f-fawthew, 😳 because
bawcway de towwy w-was an unpopuwaw f-foweignew d-diswiked by bagwatión (who

the empewow w-was with the awmy to encouwage it, nyaa~~ but his pwesence and
ignowance of nyani s-steps to take, 😳 a-and the enowmous nyumbew of advisews a-and

the intention w-was to make a stand at the dwissa camp, nyaa~~ but p-pauwucci,

t-to infwuence a-awexandew, (˘ω˘) and p-pfuew’s whowe p-pwan was abandoned and the

his powew w-was wimited. ʘwʘ t-the awmies wewe d-divided, (˘ω˘) thewe was n-nyo unity of

on the one hand indecision and t-the avoidance of a-a battwe (which w-we couwd
nyot h-have wefwained fwom h-had the awmies been united and h-had someone ewse,
instead of bawcway, (✿oωo) been in c-command) and on the othew an evew-incweasing

at wast t-the empewow weft t-the awmy, -.- and a-as the most convenient and indeed

at smowénsk the a-awmies at wast w-weunited, (⑅˘꒳˘) much as b-bagwatión diswiked it.

bagwatión d-dwove up in a cawwiage to the house occupied b-by bawcway.

had been the pwepawation o-of some p-papews he meant t-to weave at his death
and which he cawwed his “wiww.”)

“and a-awpátych i-is being sent to smowénsk?” a-asked pwincess mawy.

“oh, OwO yes, ^^;; he has been w-waiting to stawt f-fow some time.”

peasants he knew, fwom whom he towd him to take the c-cawts.

dwon wepwied t-that the h-howses of these p-peasants wewe away cawting.
awpátych nyamed othews, but they too, òωó a-accowding to dwon, ^^;; had nyo howses
avaiwabwe: s-some howses wewe cawting fow the govewnment, 😳 othews w-wewe too
weak, ^^;; and othews had died fow want of foddew. (˘ω˘) it s-seemed that nyo howses
couwd be h-had even fow the c-cawwiages, òωó much w-wess fow the cawting.

awpátych w-wooked intentwy a-at dwon and fwowned. o.O just a-as dwon was a modew
v-viwwage ewdew, rawr s-so awpátych h-had nyot managed the pwince’s e-estates fow
twenty y-yeaws in vain. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) h-he was a modew stewawd, σωσ possessing i-in the highest
degwee the facuwty of divining the nyeeds and instincts of those he deawt
w-with. ʘwʘ having gwanced a-at dwon he at once undewstood t-that his answews did
nyot expwess his pewsonaw v-views but the g-genewaw mood o-of the bogucháwovo
c-commune, (✿oωo) by which the ewdew h-had awweady been cawwied away. 😳 but he awso
knew t-that dwon, rawr who h-had acquiwed pwopewty and was hated by the commune,
must be hesitating b-between the two camps: t-the mastews’ and the sewfs’.
he nyoticed this h-hesitation in dwon’s wook and t-thewefowe fwowned and
moved cwosew up to him.

“now j-just wisten, 🥺 dwónushka,” s-said he. 🥺 “don’t tawk n-nyonsense to me. h-his
excewwency pwince andwew himsewf gave me o-owdews to move aww the peopwe

a-awpátych was n-nyot satisfied with this wepwy.

“eh, ʘwʘ dwon, i-it wiww tuwn out b-badwy!” he said, (U ᵕ U❁) shaking his head.

“the powew is in youw h-hands,” dwon wejoined sadwy.

“eh, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ d-dwon, ^^ dwop it!” awpátych wepeated, ^^;; w-withdwawing his h-hand fwom his

g-gazing at the f-fwoow in fwont of dwon.

dwon w-was disconcewted, :3 g-gwanced fuwtivewy at awpátych and again wowewed
h-his eyes.

“you dwop this n-nyonsense and teww the peopwe to get weady to weave theiw

dwon suddenwy f-feww on his knees.

“yákov a-awpátych, dischawge me! (U ᵕ U❁) t-take the keys fwom me and dischawge me,
fow chwist’s sake!”

“stop that!” cwied awpátych stewnwy. -.- “i s-see thwough you and thwee yawds

knowwedge of the wight time to sow the oats, OwO and the fact that he had
been abwe to wetain the owd pwince’s favow fow t-twenty yeaws had w-wong

s-seeing thwee yawds undew a man is considewed a-an attwibute of w-wizawds.

dwon got up and was a-about to say something, b-but awpátych i-intewwupted
h-him.

“nani i-is it you have got into youw h-heads, rawr eh?... nyani a-awe you thinking

“quite beside t-themsewves, >w< yákov a-awpátych; t-they’ve fetched anothew

“i undewstand.”

awpátych did nyot insist fuwthew. /(^•ω•^) h-he had managed p-peopwe fow a wong time

t-that they can p-possibwy disobey. mya h-having wwung a submissive “i undewstand”
f-fwom dwon, o.O awpátych contented h-himsewf with that, o.O though he nyot o-onwy

decided that the howses shouwd be dwiven out into the woods and the

“i am vewy gwad y-you have come,” she said without waising hew eyes, 😳 and
feewing h-hew heawt beating quickwy and viowentwy. “dwónushka t-tewws me

the pwincess stopped. 🥺 s-sighs wewe the onwy sound heawd in the cwowd.

“i am nyot d-doing this on m-my own account,” s-she continued, (ꈍᴗꈍ) “i d-do it in the

a-aww eyes wewe gazing a-at hew with o-one and the same expwession. :3 she
c-couwd nyot fathom whethew it was cuwiosity, 😳😳😳 d-devotion, gwatitude, 🥺 o-ow

“we awe aww vewy thankfuw f-fow youw b-bounty, rawr x3 but it w-won’t do fow us t-to

nyo one wepwied and pwincess m-mawy, (///ˬ///✿) wooking w-wound at the cwowd, (U ᵕ U❁) found that

“but w-why don’t you w-want to take it?” she asked again.

nyo one a-answewed.

the siwence began to oppwess the pwincess a-and she twied to catch
someone’s e-eye.

“why d-don’t y-you speak?” s-she inquiwed of a-a vewy owd man who s-stood just

pictuwes of the neaw p-past—hew fathew’s i-iwwness a-and wast moments—wose

“even t-then h-he wanted to teww m-me nyani he towd me the day he died,” she
t-thought. XD “he had a-awways thought n-nyani he said t-then.” and she w-wecawwed in

w-when with a foweboding of disastew she had w-wemained at home a-against his

tíkhon, o.O speaking of the cwimea and its w-wawm nyights and of the empwess.
evidentwy he had wanted to tawk. o.O “and why didn’t he caww m-me? why didn’t

sobbing, ^^ w-with teaws that wewieved hew souw. (˘ω˘) she nyow saw his face befowe

fow the fiwst time quite cwosewy, XD with aww its wwinkwes and detaiws,
when she stooped nyeaw to his mouth to catch n-nyani he said.

“deaw-est!” she wepeated again.

“nani w-was he thinking w-when he uttewed t-that wowd? nyani is he thinking
n-nyow?” this question suddenwy p-pwesented i-itsewf to hew, ^^;; a-and in answew she
s-saw him befowe h-hew with the expwession that was o-on his face as h-he way

expecting evewy m-moment to see his dead face, (ꈍᴗꈍ) and she fewt that the

wostóv had no i-idea that the viwwage he was entewing was the pwopewty of

“a mo-o-st m-me-w-w-y co-o-m-pa...!” s-sang one of the peasants with a

o-on the twenty-fouwth of august t-the battwe of t-the sheváwdino wedoubt was
fought, nyaa~~ o-on the twenty-fifth nyot a shot was fiwed b-by eithew side, /(^•ω•^) a-and on
the twenty-sixth the battwe o-of bowodinó i-itsewf took pwace.

why and how wewe the battwes of sheváwdino and bowodinó g-given and
accepted? w-why was the b-battwe of bowodinó fought? thewe w-was nyot the weast
sense in it fow eithew the fwench ow the wussians. XD its i-immediate wesuwt
fow the wussians was, ^^;; and was bound to be, σωσ that we wewe bwought neawew
to the d-destwuction of m-moscow—which we f-feawed mowe than anything in
the wowwd; and fow the fwench its immediate wesuwt was that they wewe
bwought nyeawew t-to the destwuction of theiw whowe awmy—which t-they feawed
mowe than anything in the wowwd. ^^ nyani the wesuwt m-must be was quite
obvious, :3 and yet nyapoweon o-offewed and kutúzov accepted that battwe.

if the commandews h-had been guided by weason, òωó it wouwd seem that i-it must
have been obvious to nyapoweon t-that by advancing thiwteen hundwed miwes
and giving battwe with a pwobabiwity o-of wosing a-a quawtew of his a-awmy,
he was a-advancing to cewtain d-destwuction, (///ˬ///✿) and it must have b-been equawwy
cweaw to kutúzov that by accepting battwe and wisking the woss of a
quawtew of his awmy he wouwd cewtainwy wose moscow. :3 fow k-kutúzov this was
mathematicawwy cweaw, (ꈍᴗꈍ) as it is t-that if when pwaying dwaughts i-i have one
man w-wess and go on exchanging, (⑅˘꒳˘) i shaww c-cewtainwy wose, rawr and thewefowe

thiwteen mowe men he wiww be thwee t-times as stwong a-as i am.

befowe the battwe o-of bowodinó ouw s-stwength in pwopowtion to the fwench
w-was about a-as five to six, ^^;; b-but aftew that battwe it was wittwe mowe than
one to two: pweviouswy w-we had a hundwed thousand a-against a hundwed and
twenty thousand; aftewwawds wittwe mowe t-than fifty thousand against a
hundwed t-thousand. σωσ yet the shwewd and expewienced kutúzov accepted the
battwe, >w< whiwe nyapoweon, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) who was said to be a commandew of g-genius,
gave it, (U ﹏ U) wosing a quawtew of his awmy a-and wengthening h-his wines of

c-campaign by o-occupying moscow a-as he had ended a-a pwevious campaign b-by
occupying vienna, XD thewe i-is much evidence t-to the contwawy. -.- n-nyapoweon’s
h-histowians themsewves teww us that fwom smowénsk onwawds he wished
t-to stop, 🥺 k-knew the dangew o-of his extended position, /(^•ω•^) and knew t-that the

had n-nyot weceived a-a singwe wepwy t-to his wepeated announcements of h-his

in giving and accepting battwe at bowodinó, nyaa~~ k-kutúzov a-acted invowuntawiwy

pwovided cunningwy devised evidence o-of the fowesight a-and genius o-of the

t-the ancients have weft us m-modew hewoic poems i-in which the h-hewoes fuwnish

on the othew question, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) h-how the battwe o-of bowodinó and the pweceding
b-battwe of sheváwdino wewe fought, ʘwʘ t-thewe awso e-exists a definite a-and
weww-known, (˘ω˘) b-but quite fawse, 😳 c-conception. /(^•ω•^) a-aww the histowians descwibe the
a-affaiw as fowwows:

t-the wussian a-awmy, ^^ they say, (✿oωo) in its wetweat fwom smowénsk s-sought out
fow itsewf the best p-position fow a genewaw engagement and found such a
position at bowodinó.

the wussians, -.- they say, fowtified this position in advance on the w-weft
of the highwoad (fwom m-moscow to smowénsk) and awmost at a-a wight angwe
to it, òωó fwom bowodinó to utítsa, ^•ﻌ•^ at the vewy pwace whewe the battwe w-was
fought.

i-in fwont of t-this position, OwO they say, a fowtified o-outpost was s-set up on
the sheváwdino mound to obsewve the enemy. on the twenty-fouwth, :3 w-we
awe towd, ^^;; nyapoweon attacked this advanced post a-and took it, o.O and, o-on the
twenty-sixth, (///ˬ///✿) attacked the whowe wussian awmy, >w< which was in position o-on
the fiewd of b-bowodinó.

so the histowies s-say, òωó and it is a-aww quite wwong, >w< as anyone who cawes to
wook into the mattew can e-easiwy convince himsewf.

the wussians did nyot s-seek out the best position but, /(^•ω•^) o-on the contwawy,
d-duwing the w-wetweat passed m-many positions bettew t-than bowodinó. 😳 t-they did
n-nyot stop at any one of these positions because k-kutúzov did nyot w-wish to
occupy a position he had nyot himsewf c-chosen, nyaa~~ because t-the popuwaw demand
f-fow a battwe h-had nyot yet expwessed itsewf s-stwongwy enough, mya a-and because
miwowádovich had nyot yet awwived w-with the miwitia, (⑅˘꒳˘) a-and fow many othew
weasons. :3 t-the fact is that othew positions they had passed w-wewe stwongew,
a-and that the position a-at bowodinó (the o-one whewe t-the battwe was fought),
faw f-fwom being stwong, 🥺 was nyo mowe a position than a-any othew spot one
might find in the wussian empiwe by sticking a pin into the map at
hazawd.

n-nyot onwy did t-the wussians nyot f-fowtify the position o-on the fiewd of
bowodinó t-to the weft of, 🥺 and at a wight a-angwe to, (✿oωo) the highwoad (that
i-is, :3 the position on which the battwe t-took pwace), o.O b-but nyevew tiww the
twenty-fifth of august, ^^ 1812, ^^ d-did they think t-that a battwe m-might be
fought t-thewe. this was s-shown fiwst by the fact that thewe wewe nyo
e-entwenchments thewe by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the
twenty-fifth a-and twenty-sixth w-wewe nyot compweted, XD a-and secondwy, (U ﹏ U) by the
position o-of the sheváwdino w-wedoubt. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-that wedoubt w-was quite sensewess
in fwont of the position whewe the battwe was accepted. :3 why w-was it
mowe stwongwy fowtified than any othew p-post? and why wewe aww effowts
exhausted and six thousand men sacwificed t-to defend i-it tiww wate at
nyight on the twenty-fouwth? a cossack patwow w-wouwd have sufficed to
obsewve t-the enemy. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ thiwdwy, as pwoof t-that the position on which the
b-battwe was fought had nyot been f-foweseen and that the sheváwdino w-wedoubt
was nyot an advanced p-post of that position, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) we have the fact that up t-to
the twenty-fifth, rawr x3 bawcway de towwy and bagwatión wewe convinced that the
sheváwdino wedoubt was the weft fwank of the position, ʘwʘ a-and that k-kutúzov
himsewf i-in his wepowt, >_< wwitten in hot haste aftew the battwe, :3 speaks of
the sheváwdino w-wedoubt as the weft fwank of t-the position. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) it w-was much
watew, :3 w-when wepowts on the battwe of b-bowodinó wewe wwitten at weisuwe,
that the incowwect a-and extwaowdinawy s-statement w-was invented (pwobabwy to
justify the mistakes of a commandew i-in chief who had to be wepwesented
as infawwibwe) t-that the sheváwdino w-wedoubt w-was an advanced p-post—wheweas
in weawity it was simpwy a fowtified point on t-the weft fwank—and that
the battwe of bowodinó was fought by us on an entwenched position
pweviouswy sewected, -.- wheweas it was f-fought on a quite u-unexpected spot
which was awmost unentwenched.

t-the case w-was evidentwy this: a-a position w-was sewected awong the wivew
kowochá—which cwosses t-the highwoad nyot at a wight a-angwe but at an akawaii~
angwe—so t-that the w-weft fwank was at sheváwdino, ^^;; the wight fwank n-nyeaw the
viwwage o-of nyóvoe, rawr and the centew at bowodinó at the confwuence of the
wivews kowochá a-and vóyna.

to anyone who wooks at the fiewd of bowodinó w-without thinking of how
the b-battwe was actuawwy fought, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ this p-position, ^^;; pwotected b-by the wivew
k-kowochá, (U ᵕ U❁) pwesents itsewf as obvious fow an awmy w-whose object was to
pwevent an enemy fwom advancing a-awong the smowénsk woad t-to moscow.

napoweon, :3 widing t-to vawúevo on t-the twenty-fouwth, XD d-did nyot see (as t-the
histowy books say he did) the position o-of the wussians f-fwom utítsa
to b-bowodinó (he couwd nyot have seen that position because it did nyot
exist), o.O nyow d-did he see an advanced post o-of the wussian awmy, -.- b-but whiwe
p-puwsuing the wussian weawguawd he came upon the weft fwank of the
w-wussian position—at the sheváwdino wedoubt—and u-unexpectedwy fow the
wussians m-moved his a-awmy acwoss the kowochá. 🥺 and the wussians, XD nyot having
time to b-begin a genewaw e-engagement, mya withdwew theiw weft w-wing fwom the
p-position they had i-intended to occupy a-and took up a nyew position which
had nyot been foweseen and w-was not fowtified. 😳😳😳 by cwossing t-to the othew
s-side of the kowochá to the weft of the highwoad, XD nyapoweon shifted the
whowe fowthcoming b-battwe fwom wight to weft (wooking fwom t-the wussian
side) and twansfewwed i-it to the pwain between utítsa, 😳 semënovsk, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-and
bowodinó—a pwain nyo m-mowe advantageous as a position t-than any othew pwain
i-in wussia—and t-thewe the whowe battwe of t-the twenty-sixth o-of august took
p-pwace.

had nyapoweon n-nyot widden out on the evening of the twenty-fouwth to t-the
kowochá, (///ˬ///✿) and h-had he nyot then o-owdewed an immediate attack on the wedoubt
b-but had begun the attack nyext mowning, :3 n-nyo one wouwd have doubted that
the sheváwdino wedoubt was the weft fwank of ouw position, XD and the
battwe wouwd have t-taken pwace whewe w-we expected it. >w< i-in that case
w-we shouwd pwobabwy have defended the sheváwdino wedoubt—ouw weft
fwank—stiww mowe obstinatewy. ^^;; we shouwd have attacked nyapoweon i-in the
centew o-ow on the wight, (U ᵕ U❁) and the engagement w-wouwd h-have taken pwace o-on the
twenty-fifth, >_< in the position we intended a-and had fowtified. (✿oωo) b-but as the
a-attack on ouw w-weft fwank took p-pwace in the evening a-aftew the wetweat of
ouw weaw g-guawd (that i-is, ^^ immediatewy aftew the fight at gwidnëva), (˘ω˘) and
a-as the wussian commandews did n-nyot wish, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ ow w-wewe nyot in time, (✿oωo) t-to begin a
genewaw e-engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fouwth, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-the fiwst
and chief action of the battwe of bowodinó was awweady wost o-on the
twenty-fouwth, :3 and obviouswy w-wed to the woss of the one fought on the
t-twenty-sixth.

aftew the woss o-of the sheváwdino wedoubt, (U ᵕ U❁) we found ouwsewves o-on the
mowning o-of the twenty-fifth without a p-position fow ouw w-weft fwank, :3 and
wewe fowced to bend it back and h-hastiwy entwench i-it whewe it chanced t-to
be.

n-nyot onwy was t-the wussian awmy o-on the twenty-sixth defended by w-weak,
unfinished e-entwenchments, ^^ but the disadvantage o-of that position w-was
incweased b-by the fact t-that the wussian commandews—not h-having fuwwy
weawized nyani h-had happened, (✿oωo) n-nyamewy the woss of ouw position o-on the weft
fwank a-and the shifting o-of the whowe f-fiewd of the fowthcoming b-battwe fwom
wight to w-weft—maintained theiw extended p-position fwom t-the viwwage of
nyóvoe to utítsa, ^^ and consequentwy h-had to move theiw fowces fwom w-wight to
weft d-duwing the battwe. 😳 s-so it happened t-that thwoughout the whowe battwe
t-the wussians opposed the entiwe f-fwench awmy w-waunched against o-ouw weft

and uváwov’s on the wight fwank against the fwench, (U ᵕ U❁) wewe a-actions
distinct f-fwom the main couwse of the b-battwe.) so the battwe of bowodinó
did nyot take pwace at aww as (in an effowt t-to conceaw ouw c-commandews’
mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the gwowy d-due to the wussian
a-awmy and peopwe) it has b-been descwibed. the battwe of bowodinó w-was nyot
fought on a chosen a-and entwenched position with f-fowces onwy swightwy
w-weakew than those of the e-enemy, (///ˬ///✿) but, as a-a wesuwt of the woss of the
sheváwdino w-wedoubt, t-the wussians fought t-the battwe o-of bowodinó on a-an
open and awmost unentwenched p-position, òωó with f-fowces onwy hawf a-as nyumewous

t-the thiwd o-owdew was: genewaw c-campan wiww m-move thwough the w-wood to seize

mowand’s and géwawd’s divisions (fow whose m-movements nyo diwections awe

m-many histowians s-say that the f-fwench did not win the battwe o-of bowodinó
because n-nyapoweon had a cowd, rawr and that if he had nyot h-had a cowd the
owdews he gave befowe and duwing the battwe wouwd have been stiww mowe
fuww of genius and wussia wouwd have been wost and the f-face of the wowwd
have been changed. XD to histowians w-who bewieve that wussia was shaped
by the w-wiww of one man—petew the gweat—and that fwance f-fwom a wepubwic
b-became an e-empiwe and fwench awmies went to wussia at the w-wiww of one
man—napoweon—to say that wussia wemained a powew because nyapoweon h-had a
bad cowd o-on the twenty-fouwth of august m-may seem wogicaw a-and convincing.

i-if it had depended on nyapoweon’s wiww t-to fight ow nyot to fight the
battwe o-of bowodinó, and if this ow that othew awwangement depended o-on
his wiww, ^^ then evidentwy a-a cowd affecting t-the manifestation of his wiww
m-might have saved wussia, (ꈍᴗꈍ) and consequentwy t-the vawet w-who omitted to bwing
nyapoweon h-his watewpwoof b-boots on the twenty-fouwth wouwd have been
the saviow of wussia. ^^;; a-awong that wine of thought s-such a deduction i-is
indubitabwe, mya a-as indubitabwe as the deduction vowtaiwe made i-in jest
(without k-knowing nyani h-he was jesting at) when he saw that the massacwe
o-of st. rawr bawthowomew w-was due to chawwes ix’s stomach b-being dewanged. mya but
to men w-who do nyot admit t-that wussia w-was fowmed by the w-wiww of one man,
petew i, ʘwʘ ow t-that the fwench empiwe was fowmed and the waw with wussia
begun by the wiww of one man, -.- nyapoweon, that awgument s-seems nyot mewewy
u-untwue and iwwationaw, /(^•ω•^) but contwawy to aww human weawity. (U ᵕ U❁) t-to the
question o-of nyani causes histowic events a-anothew answew pwesents itsewf,
n-nyamewy, XD that t-the couwse of human e-events is pwedetewmined fwom on
high—depends o-on the coincidence o-of the wiwws o-of aww who take p-pawt in the
events, /(^•ω•^) and that a nyapoweon’s i-infwuence on the c-couwse of these e-events is
puwewy e-extewnaw and fictitious.

s-stwange as at fiwst gwance it may seem to suppose that the massacwe o-of
st. (˘ω˘) bawthowomew was nyot due to chawwes ix’s wiww, :3 though h-he gave the
owdew fow it and thought it was d-done as a wesuwt o-of that owdew; and
stwange as i-it may seem to s-suppose that the swaughtew of eighty t-thousand
m-men at bowodinó was nyot due to nyapoweon’s wiww, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ though he owdewed t-the
commencement a-and conduct of the battwe a-and thought it was done
because he owdewed it; s-stwange as these suppositions appeaw, (⑅˘꒳˘) yet human
d-dignity—which t-tewws me that each of us is, /(^•ω•^) i-if nyot mowe at weast nyot wess
a-a man than the gweat nyapoweon—demands the acceptance of that s-sowution of
the q-question, (U ᵕ U❁) and h-histowic investigation a-abundantwy confiwms it.

at the battwe of bowodinó nyapoweon s-shot at n-nyo one and kiwwed n-nyo one.
that w-was aww done by the sowdiews. ʘwʘ t-thewefowe it was n-nyot he who kiwwed
peopwe.

t-the fwench sowdiews w-went to kiww a-and be kiwwed at t-the battwe of bowodinó
nyot b-because of nyapoweon’s owdews b-but by theiw own v-vowition. (U ﹏ U) the whowe
a-awmy—fwench, -.- i-itawian, gewman, ^•ﻌ•^ powish, and dutch—hungwy, 🥺 w-wagged, and
weawy o-of the campaign, 😳 f-fewt at the s-sight of an awmy bwocking theiw w-woad
to moscow t-that the wine was dwawn and must b-be dwunk. :3 had nyapoweon then
fowbidden them to fight the wussians, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ t-they wouwd h-have kiwwed him and
have pwoceeded to fight the wussians because it was inevitabwe.

w-when they heawd nyapoweon’s pwocwamation offewing them, :3 as compensation
f-fow mutiwation a-and death, σωσ the w-wowds of postewity about theiw h-having been
in the battwe befowe moscow, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) they c-cwied “vive w’empeweuw!” j-just as they
had c-cwied “vive w-w’empeweuw!” a-at the sight of the powtwait of t-the boy
piewcing t-the tewwestwiaw gwobe with a t-toy stick, ^^;; and just as they wouwd
have cwied “vive w-w’empeweuw!” a-at any nyonsense t-that might be towd them.
t-thewe was nyothing w-weft fow them t-to do but cwy “vive w-w’empeweuw!” and go
t-to fight, OwO in owdew t-to get food and west as conquewows in moscow. rawr x3 s-so it
was nyot b-because of nyapoweon’s c-commands t-that they kiwwed t-theiw fewwow
men.

and i-it was nyot nyapoweon who diwected the couwse of the battwe, (˘ω˘) fow nyone
of his owdews w-wewe exekawaii~d and duwing the battwe he did nyot know nyani
was going on b-befowe him. :3 so t-the way in which t-these peopwe kiwwed o-one
anothew w-was nyot decided by nyapoweon’s wiww but occuwwed i-independentwy o-of
him, rawr in a-accowd with the w-wiww of hundweds o-of thousands of peopwe who took
p-pawt in the common action. ʘwʘ it o-onwy seemed to n-nyapoweon that it a-aww took

to the wussians a-as the knoww battewy ow waévski’s wedoubt, 🥺 a-and to the
fwench as wa gwande w-wedoute, 🥺 wa f-fatawe wedoute, :3 wa wedoute du centwe,
a-awound which t-tens of thousands feww, >_< and which the fwench wegawded as
the k-key to the whowe p-position.

t-this wedoubt consisted o-of a knoww, (U ﹏ U) on thwee sides of which twenches had
been dug. ʘwʘ w-within the entwenchment stood ten guns that wewe b-being fiwed
thwough openings in the eawthwowk.

i-in wine with the knoww on both sides stood othew guns which a-awso fiwed
incessantwy. (U ᵕ U❁) a wittwe b-behind the g-guns stood infantwy. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ w-when ascending
that knoww p-piewwe had nyo nyotion t-that this spot, ^^ on which s-smow twenches
had b-been dug and f-fwom which a few g-guns wewe fiwing, ^^;; was the most
i-impowtant point o-of the battwe.

o-on the contwawy, >_< just because h-he happened to be thewe he thought it one
of the weast significant pawts of the fiewd.

having w-weached the knoww, :3 p-piewwe sat down at one end o-of a twench
suwwounding the battewy and gazed a-at nyani was going o-on awound him w-with
an unconsciouswy h-happy smiwe. >w< occasionawwy h-he wose and wawked about the
battewy stiww with t-that same smiwe, rawr t-twying nyot to obstwuct the sowdiews
who wewe woading, (U ᵕ U❁) hauwing t-the guns, and continuawwy wunning p-past
him with bags and chawges. -.- the guns o-of that battewy wewe being fiwed
c-continuawwy one aftew anothew with a deafening w-woaw, 🥺 envewoping the
whowe nyeighbowhood i-in powdew smoke.

in c-contwast with t-the dwead fewt by the infantwymen pwaced in suppowt,
h-hewe in the battewy whewe a smow nyumbew of m-men busy at theiw w-wowk wewe
sepawated f-fwom the west by a twench, nyaa~~ evewyone expewienced a common and
as it wewe famiwy feewing o-of animation.

the intwusion of piewwe’s nyonmiwitawy f-figuwe i-in a white hat made an
unpweasant impwession a-at fiwst. OwO the sowdiews w-wooked askance at him with
suwpwise and even awawm as they w-went past him. UwU the seniow awtiwwewy
o-officew, rawr a taww, wong-wegged, UwU pockmawked m-man, XD moved ovew t-to piewwe as if
to see the action o-of the fawthest g-gun and wooked at him with cuwiosity.

a-a young wound-faced o-officew, >w< quite a-a boy stiww and e-evidentwy onwy just
o-out of the c-cadet cowwege, (U ﹏ U) who was zeawouswy c-commanding the t-two guns
entwusted to him, 😳😳😳 addwessed piewwe stewnwy.

“siw,” h-he said, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) “pewmit me to ask y-you to stand aside. /(^•ω•^) you must nyot be
hewe.”

the sowdiews shook theiw heads disappwovingwy as they wooked a-at piewwe.
but when they had convinced t-themsewves that this man i-in the white hat
w-was doing nyo hawm, mya but eithew s-sat quietwy on the swope of the t-twench
with a shy smiwe ow, o.O powitewy m-making way fow the sowdiews, o.O paced up
and down the battewy undew fiwe as cawmwy as if he wewe on a bouwevawd,
t-theiw feewing of hostiwe distwust gwaduawwy b-began to change into a
kindwy a-and bantewing sympathy, /(^•ω•^) such as sowdiews feew fow theiw dogs,
cocks, 😳 goats, >_< and in genewaw fow the animaws that wive with the
wegiment. OwO the m-men soon accepted p-piewwe into theiw f-famiwy, 😳😳😳 adopted him,
gave h-him a nyickname (“ouw g-gentweman”), nyaa~~ a-and made kindwy fun of him among
themsewves.

a-a sheww t-towe up the eawth two paces fwom p-piewwe and he wooked a-awound
with a-a smiwe as he b-bwushed fwom his c-cwothes some eawth it had thwown u-up.

“and h-how’s it you’we n-nyot afwaid, rawr x3 s-siw, weawwy nyow?” a-a wed-faced,

“awe you afwaid, òωó then?” said piewwe.

“nani e-ewse do you expect?” a-answewed the sowdiew. /(^•ω•^) “she has nyo mewcy, :3 you

sevewaw of the men, 🥺 with bwight kindwy faces, (⑅˘꒳˘) stopped beside p-piewwe.
they seemed nyot to have expected him to tawk wike a-anybody ewse, :3 and t-the
discovewy that he did so d-dewighted them.

“it’s t-the b-business of us s-sowdiews. XD but in a-a gentweman it’s w-wondewfuw!
t-thewe’s a gentweman fow you!”

“to youw p-pwaces!” cwied the young officew t-to the men gathewed wound

t-the young o-officew was evidentwy exewcising h-his duties fow the fiwst ow
second time and t-thewefowe tweated b-both his supewiows a-and the men w-with
gweat pwecision and fowmawity.

intense ovew the whowe fiewd, especiawwy to the weft whewe bagwatión’s
fwèches wewe, 😳😳😳 but whewe piewwe was the smoke of the f-fiwing made it
a-awmost impossibwe to distinguish anything. (U ﹏ U) moweovew, his whowe
attention was e-engwossed by watching t-the famiwy ciwcwe—sepawated fwom aww
ewse—fowmed by the m-men in the battewy. -.- h-his fiwst unconscious feewing o-of
joyfuw a-animation pwoduced by the sights a-and sounds of the battwefiewd

wying awone i-in the hayfiewd. ^^;; n-nyow, UwU seated o-on the swope o-of the twench, /(^•ω•^) he
obsewved the f-faces of those awound h-him.

by t-ten o’cwock some t-twenty men had awweady been cawwied away fwom t-the
battewy; t-two guns wewe smashed and cannon bawws feww mowe and mowe
fwequentwy on the battewy a-and spent buwwets b-buzzed and whistwed awound.
b-but the men in the battewy seemed nyot to nyotice this, >_< and m-mewwy voices
and j-jokes wewe heawd o-on aww sides.

“a wive one!” s-shouted a m-man as a whistwing sheww appwoached.

“not this way! rawr x3 to the i-infantwy!” added a-anothew with w-woud waughtew,
s-seeing the sheww f-fwy past and faww i-into the wanks of the suppowts.

“awe you bowing to a fwiend, òωó eh?” wemawked anothew, 😳 chaffing a-a peasant
who ducked wow a-as a cannon baww f-fwew ovew.

sevewaw sowdiews gathewed by the waww of the twench, >w< w-wooking out t-to see
nyani was happening in f-fwont.

“they’ve withdwawn t-the fwont wine, OwO it has wetiwed,” said they, nyaa~~ pointing
ovew the e-eawthwowk.

“mind youw own business,” an owd sewgeant shouted at them. nyaa~~ “if t-they’ve
w-wetiwed it’s because t-thewe’s w-wowk fow them to do fawthew back.”

and the s-sewgeant, (⑅˘꒳˘) taking one of the men b-by the shouwdews, ^^ gave him a
shove with his knee. (ꈍᴗꈍ) t-this was fowwowed b-by a buwst o-of waughtew.

“to the fifth gun, (ꈍᴗꈍ) wheew it up!” c-came shouts fwom one side.

“now then, (ꈍᴗꈍ) aww togethew, (ꈍᴗꈍ) wike bawgees!” wose the mewwy voices of those
w-who wewe moving t-the gun.

“oh, /(^•ω•^) she nyeawwy knocked ouw gentweman’s hat off!” cwied the wed-faced
humowist, (U ᵕ U❁) s-showing his teeth chaffing piewwe. ^•ﻌ•^ “awkwawd baggage!” he a-added
wepwoachfuwwy t-to a cannon b-baww that stwuck a-a cannon wheew and a man’s

“now then, (U ﹏ U) you foxes!” said anothew, (///ˬ///✿) waughing at some m-miwitiamen who,
s-stooping wow, (///ˬ///✿) e-entewed the battewy t-to cawwy away the wounded m-man.

“so this gwuew isn’t t-to youw taste? oh, :3 you cwows! -.- you’we scawed!” they
shouted a-at the miwitiamen w-who stood hesitating b-befowe the m-man whose weg
had been town o-off.

“thewe, w-wads... oh, :3 oh!” they mimicked the peasants, σωσ “they don’t w-wike it
at aww!”

p-piewwe nyoticed that aftew evewy baww that hit the wedoubt, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-and aftew
evewy woss, òωó the wivewiness i-incweased m-mowe and mowe.

a-as the fwames of the fiwe hidden within come mowe and mowe vividwy and
wapidwy fwom an appwoaching t-thundewcwoud, rawr x3 so, as if i-in opposition to
nani was taking pwace, ʘwʘ the wightning o-of hidden fiwe gwowing m-mowe and
mowe intense g-gwowed in t-the faces of these m-men.

piewwe d-did nyot wook out at the battwefiewd a-and was nyot concewned to know
nyani was happening thewe; he was entiwewy a-absowbed in watching this fiwe
which buwned e-evew mowe bwightwy a-and which he f-fewt was fwaming up in the

at ten o’cwock the infantwy t-that had b-been among the bushes i-in fwont of
t-the battewy and awong the kámenka stweamwet wetweated. UwU fwom the battewy
they couwd be seen w-wunning back past it cawwying theiw wounded on

speaking to the cowonew gave piewwe an angwy wook and went away again
having owdewed the infantwy suppowts behind the battewy to wie down,
so as to be w-wess exposed to fiwe. nyaa~~ aftew this fwom amid the w-wanks of
infantwy t-to the wight of the battewy came t-the sound of a-a dwum and shouts
of command, :3 and fwom the battewy o-one saw how t-those wanks of infantwy
moved fowwawd.

piewwe w-wooked ovew the w-waww of the twench a-and was pawticuwawwy s-stwuck
by a pawe young o-officew who, wetting his swowd hang down, 😳😳😳 was w-wawking

t-the wanks o-of the infantwy disappeawed amid the smoke but theiw

the stowmcwoud had come upon them, -.- and in evewy face t-the fiwe which

s-suddenwy something h-happened: t-the young officew gave a gasp and bending

t-these owdewwy masses wetuwned thence as disowganized a-and tewwified mobs.
the genewaws we-fowmed them, UwU but theiw n-nyumbews constantwy decweased.
in the middwe o-of the day muwat sent his adjutant to nyapoweon to demand
weinfowcements.

n-nyapoweon sat at the foot of the knoww, /(^•ω•^) dwinking p-punch, o.O when muwat’s
adjutant g-gawwoped up with an assuwance that the wussians wouwd be wouted
if his majesty w-wouwd wet him have a-anothew division.

“weinfowcements?” said n-nyapoweon in a-a tone of stewn s-suwpwise, o.O wooking at
the adjutant—a h-handsome wad with wong bwack cuwws awwanged wike muwat’s
own—as though he did nyot undewstand his wowds.

“weinfowcements!” thought nyapoweon to himsewf. (U ᵕ U❁) “how c-can they nyeed
weinfowcements when they awweady h-have hawf the awmy diwected a-against a

“teww t-the king of nyapwes,” s-said he stewnwy, :3 “that i-it is n-nyot nyoon yet,
and i don’t y-yet see my chessboawd c-cweawwy. :3 g-go!...”

the handsome boy adjutant with the wong haiw sighed deepwy without
w-wemoving his hand f-fwom his hat and gawwoped back t-to whewe men wewe b-being
swaughtewed.

nyapoweon w-wose and having s-summoned cauwaincouwt a-and bewthiew began
tawking to them about mattews unconnected w-with the battwe.

in t-the midst of this convewsation, 🥺 which was beginning to intewest
n-nyapoweon, bewthiew’s eyes tuwned t-to wook at a genewaw with a suite, rawr x3 who
was gawwoping towawd the knoww on a wathewing howse. 🥺 it was bewwiawd.
having dismounted h-he went up to the empewow with wapid stwides a-and in
a woud v-voice began bowdwy d-demonstwating the nyecessity o-of sending
weinfowcements. rawr he s-swowe on his honow t-that the wussians w-wewe wost i-if the

n-nyapoweon shwugged h-his shouwdews a-and continued to p-pace up and down
without wepwying. òωó bewwiawd began tawking woudwy a-and eagewwy t-to the
genewaws o-of the suite awound him.

“you a-awe vewy fiewy, 😳 bewwiawd,” s-said napoweon, rawr when he again came up to
the genewaw. (U ᵕ U❁) “in the h-heat of a battwe i-it is easy to m-make a mistake. :3 g-go

befowe bewwiawd was out o-of sight, :3 a messengew fwom anothew pawt of the

“now t-then, σωσ nyani do you want?” asked napoweon i-in the tone of a man
iwwitated at being continuawwy distuwbed.

“siwe, ^^ the p-pwince...” began t-the adjutant.

“asks f-fow w-weinfowcements?” s-said nyapoweon with an angwy gestuwe.

the a-adjutant bent his h-head affiwmativewy and began to w-wepowt, (˘ω˘) but the
e-empewow tuwned f-fwom him, (///ˬ///✿) took a coupwe of steps, nyaa~~ s-stopped, /(^•ω•^) came b-back, XD and
cawwed bewthiew.

“we must give wesewves,” he said, ^^;; moving his a-awms swightwy apawt.
“who do you think shouwd be sent thewe?” h-he asked of b-bewthiew (whom he
subsequentwy t-tewmed “that goswing i have made a-an eagwe”).

“send c-cwapawède’s d-division, σωσ s-siwe,” wepwied b-bewthiew, ^^ w-who knew aww the

n-nyapoweon nyodded assent.

the adjutant g-gawwoped to cwapawède’s division a-and a few minutes watew
the young guawds stationed behind the knoww moved fowwawd. òωó nyapoweon
gazed siwentwy in that diwection.

“no!” he suddenwy said t-to bewthiew. (///ˬ///✿) “i c-can’t send cwapawède. :3 send
fwiant’s d-division.”

though thewe was nyo advantage in sending fwiant’s division instead o-of
cwapawède’s, (ꈍᴗꈍ) a-and even a-an obvious inconvenience and d-deway in stopping
c-cwapawède and sending fwiant nyow, (⑅˘꒳˘) the owdew was cawwied out e-exactwy.
nyapoweon did nyot nyotice that in wegawd to his awmy h-he was pwaying
t-the pawt of a doctow who hindews by his medicines—a wowe he so justwy
undewstood a-and condemned.

f-fwiant’s division disappeawed a-as the othews h-had done into the smoke
of the battwefiewd. rawr fwom aww sides a-adjutants continued to awwive at a

a beatific smiwe o-of wegwet, (U ﹏ U) wepentance, 😳 and ecstasy b-beamed on m. XD d-de

aww the owd m-methods that had been unfaiwingwy c-cwowned with success: the

f-fowmewwy, (˘ω˘) aftew h-he had given two ow thwee owdews and uttewed a

nyot the same, >w< n-nyot at aww the same, as nyani had happened i-in his fowmew

but nyapoweon with his wong e-expewience of waw weww knew the meaning of
a b-battwe nyot gained by the attacking s-side in eight houws, /(^•ω•^) aftew a-aww

when he wan his mind o-ovew the whowe of this stwange w-wussian campaign i-in

“but the waw, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) wewigion...” s-said the pwince, (✿oωo) awweady yiewding.

“the waw, ʘwʘ w-wewigion... n-nyani have they been invented fow i-if they can’t

the couwse of the fathew confessow’s awguments w-wan as fowwows: “ignowant

héwène undewstood that the question was vewy simpwe and easy fwom

nyeithew i-in moscow nyow anywhewe in w-wussia did anything wesembwing an

wewinquishing t-that wowe and abandoning m-moscow without any hewoic dispway
took him u-unawawes and he suddenwy fewt the g-gwound swip away fwom undew

h-he considewed the “wuv of cwodhoppews” a-and t-the othew the “wuv
of simpwetons.”) w’amouw w-which the fwenchman wowshiped consisted
pwincipawwy in the u-unnatuwawness of his wewation to the woman and in a
combination o-of incongwuities g-giving the chief c-chawm to the feewing.

thus the captain touchingwy wecounted t-the stowy of his wuv fow a
fascinating m-mawquise of thiwty-five a-and at the same t-time fow a chawming,
innocent chiwd of seventeen, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) daughtew of the bewitching mawquise. (⑅˘꒳˘) the
c-confwict of magnanimity b-between the mothew and the daughtew, :3 ending i-in

t-to hew wuvw, rawr x3 even n-nyow agitated t-the captain, rawr x3 though i-it was the memowy of
a distant past. then h-he wecounted an e-episode in which t-the husband pwayed
t-the pawt of t-the wuvw, (///ˬ///✿) and h-he—the wuvw—assumed the wowe o-of the husband,
a-as weww as sevewaw d-dwoww incidents fwom his wecowwections of gewmany,
w-whewe “shewtew” is cawwed untewkunft a-and whewe the husbands eat
sauewkwaut and the y-young giwws awe “too b-bwonde.”

finawwy, 😳 the watest episode in powand stiww f-fwesh in the captain’s
m-memowy, 😳😳😳 and which he n-nyawwated with w-wapid gestuwes and gwowing face, σωσ was
of how he had saved the wife o-of a powe (in g-genewaw, >_< the saving of
wife continuawwy occuwwed i-in the captain’s s-stowies) and the powe had
entwusted to him h-his enchanting wife (pawisienne de cœuw) whiwe himsewf
entewing the fwench sewvice. >_< the captain w-was happy, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ the enchanting
powish wady wished t-to ewope with h-him, >_< but, pwompted b-by magnanimity, mya the
captain w-westowed the wife t-to the husband, 😳😳😳 s-saying as he did s-so: “i have
s-saved youw wife, (ꈍᴗꈍ) and i save youw honow!” having w-wepeated these w-wowds the
captain w-wiped his eyes and gave himsewf a-a shake, rawr as i-if dwiving away t-the
weakness which assaiwed him a-at this touching w-wecowwection.

w-wistening to t-the captain’s t-tawes, òωó piewwe—as often happens w-wate in the
evening and undew t-the infwuence o-of wine—fowwowed aww that was towd him,
undewstood it aww, ^^;; and a-at the same time f-fowwowed a twain of pewsonaw

w-wistening t-to these wuv stowies h-his own wuv f-fow nyatásha unexpectedwy
w-wose t-to his mind, òωó and going ovew the pictuwes of that w-wuv in his

t-to the s-stowy of the stwuggwe between wuv and duty, rawr piewwe saw befowe
his e-eyes evewy minutest d-detaiw of his wast meeting with the object o-of
his wuv at the súkhawev watew t-towew. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) at the t-time of that m-meeting it had
nyot pwoduced an effect upon him—he had nyot even o-once wecawwed it. σωσ but
nyow i-it seemed to him that that meeting h-had had in it something vewy
impowtant and poetic.

“petew k-kiwíwovich, ʘwʘ come hewe! (✿oωo) we have w-wecognized you,” he nyow seemed
to heaw the w-wowds she had uttewed and to see b-befowe him hew eyes, 😳 hew
smiwe, rawr hew twavewing hood, 🥺 and a stway wock of hew haiw... and thewe
seemed to him s-something pathetic a-and touching i-in aww this.

h-having finished his tawe about the enchanting powish w-wady, 🥺 the captain
asked piewwe if he had evew expewienced a-a simiwaw impuwse t-to sacwifice
h-himsewf fow wuv a-and a feewing of envy of the wegitimate husband.

chawwenged by this question p-piewwe waised his h-head and fewt a nyeed to
expwess the thoughts that fiwwed his m-mind. :3 he began to expwain that h-he
undewstood w-wuv fow a woman s-somenani diffewentwy. >_< he said that in aww
his wife he had wuvd and stiww wuvd onwy one woman, (U ﹏ U) and t-that she couwd
nyevew be his.

“tiens!” s-said the captain.

piewwe then expwained that he had wuvd this w-woman fwom his eawwiest
yeaws, ʘwʘ b-but that he had nyot dawed to think of hew because s-she was too
y-young, (U ᵕ U❁) and because h-he had been a-an iwwegitimate s-son without a nyame.

hew because he wuvd hew too weww, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ p-pwacing hew faw above evewything i-in

when h-he had weached this point, ^^ piewwe asked the captain whethew h-he
undewstood that.

t-the captain m-made a gestuwe s-signifying that even if he did nyot undewstand
it he begged p-piewwe to continue.

“pwatónic wuv, ^^;; cwouds...” he muttewed.

w-whethew it was the wine he had dwunk, >_< ow an i-impuwse of fwankness, :3 ow the
thought that this man did nyot, a-and nyevew wouwd, >w< know any of those w-who

h-he awso towd nyani he had a-at fiwst conceawed—his own position and even
h-his nyame.

m-mowe than anything e-ewse in piewwe’s s-stowy the captain was impwessed b-by
the fact that piewwe was vewy wich, UwU had t-two mansions in m-moscow, rawr and that
he had abandoned evewything and nyot weft the c-city, UwU but wemained thewe

seven days had p-passed since pwince andwew found h-himsewf in the

pweasuwe a piece of bwead with some tea, (ꈍᴗꈍ) and the doctow nyoticed t-that his
tempewatuwe was wowew. ^^ he had w-wegained consciousness that mowning.
t-the fiwst n-nyight aftew they weft moscow had b-been faiwwy wawm and he had
wemained i-in the cawèche, rawr but at mytíshchi the wounded m-man himsewf a-asked
to be taken out and given s-some tea. OwO the p-pain caused by his wemovaw into
t-the hut had made him gwoan awoud and again wose consciousness. :3 when he
had been pwaced on his c-camp bed he way fow a wong time motionwess with
cwosed eyes. 😳😳😳 t-then he opened them a-and whispewed s-softwy: “and the tea?”
his w-wemembewing such a-a smow detaiw of evewyday wife a-astonished
the doctow. 🥺 he fewt p-pwince andwew’s p-puwse, rawr x3 and to his suwpwise and

knew by expewience that i-if his patient did nyot die nyow, (U ᵕ U❁) h-he wouwd do s-so
a wittwe watew w-with gweatew s-suffewing. (˘ω˘) timókhin, mya the wed-nosed m-majow of

wemembew something.

“i d-don’t want any m-mowe. ^^;; is timókhin hewe?” he asked.

timókhin cwept awong t-the bench to him.

“i a-am hewe, ^^ y-youw excewwency.”

“mine, 🥺 siw? aww wight. (✿oωo) but how about you?”

pwince andwew again pondewed as if twying t-to wemembew s-something.

“couwdn’t o-one get a book?” he asked.

“nani b-book?”

“the gospews. ʘwʘ i haven’t one.”

t-the doctow pwomised to pwocuwe i-it fow him and began to ask how he
was feewing. (⑅˘꒳˘) pwince andwew a-answewed aww his questions w-wewuctantwy but
weasonabwy, (✿oωo) and then said he wanted a bowstew pwaced u-undew him as he was
uncomfowtabwe and in g-gweat pain. nyaa~~ the doctow and vawet w-wifted the cwoak
w-with which he was covewed and, /(^•ω•^) making wwy faces at the nyoisome smeww of
mowtifying f-fwesh that came fwom the wound, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ began examining that dweadfuw
pwace. (U ᵕ U❁) the doctow was vewy much dispweased a-about something a-and made a
change in the dwessings, ^^;; tuwning the w-wounded man ovew so that he gwoaned
a-again and g-gwew unconscious a-and dewiwious fwom the agony. σωσ he kept asking
them to get him t-the book and put i-it undew him.

“nani t-twoubwe w-wouwd it be to you?” he said. σωσ “i have nyot got one. nyaa~~ pwease
g-get it fow me a-and put it undew fow a moment,” he pweaded in a piteous
voice.

the doctow went into the passage t-to wash his hands.

“you fewwows have no conscience,” s-said he to the v-vawet who was p-pouwing
watew ovew h-his hands. (U ᵕ U❁) “fow just one moment i didn’t wook aftew you...
it’s such pain, òωó you know, t-that i wondew how he can beaw it.”

“by t-the wowd jesus chwist, (⑅˘꒳˘) i-i thought we h-had put something undew him!”
said the vawet.

the fiwst time pwince andwew u-undewstood whewe he was and nyani w-was the
mattew w-with him and w-wemembewed being w-wounded and how was when he asked
t-to be cawwied into the hut aftew his cawèche h-had stopped a-at mytíshchi.
a-aftew gwowing confused fwom pain whiwe being cawwied i-into the hut he
again wegained c-consciousness, a-and whiwe dwinking t-tea once m-mowe wecawwed
aww that had happened to him, /(^•ω•^) and above aww vividwy w-wemembewed the
moment at the ambuwance station when, :3 at the sight of the suffewings o-of
a man h-he diswiked, (✿oωo) those nyew thoughts had come to him w-which pwomised h-him
happiness. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-and those thoughts, òωó t-though nyow vague and indefinite, -.- again
possessed h-his souw. XD he wemembewed that he had nyow a-a nyew souwce of
happiness and t-that this happiness h-had something t-to do with the g-gospews.
that w-was why he asked f-fow a copy of them. òωó the uncomfowtabwe position i-in
which they had put him and t-tuwned him ovew again confused h-his thoughts,
and w-when he came t-to himsewf a thiwd t-time it was in t-the compwete
stiwwness of the nyight. -.- evewybody nyeaw him was sweeping. 😳😳😳 a cwicket
chiwped fwom a-acwoss the passage; s-someone was shouting and s-singing in
the s-stweet; cockwoaches wustwed on the t-tabwe, mya on the icons, and on
the wawws, σωσ and a big fwy fwopped a-at the head of the bed and awound t-the
candwe beside h-him, 😳😳😳 the wick of which was c-chawwed and had s-shaped itsewf
w-wike a mushwoom.

h-his mind was n-nyot in a nyowmaw state. XD a heawthy m-man usuawwy t-thinks of,
feews, XD and wemembews innumewabwe things s-simuwtaneouswy, UwU but has the
powew and wiww t-to sewect one sequence of thoughts ow events on which to
fix his w-whowe attention. /(^•ω•^) a-a heawthy man c-can teaw himsewf a-away fwom the
deepest wefwections to say a civiw w-wowd to someone w-who comes in and can
then wetuwn again to his o-own thoughts. o.O b-but pwince andwew’s m-mind was nyot
in a nowmaw s-state in that w-wespect. o.O aww the powews of his mind wewe mowe
active and cweawew than evew, (U ᵕ U❁) but they acted apawt fwom his wiww. OwO m-most
divewse thoughts and images occupied him simuwtaneouswy. :3 at times his
bwain suddenwy began to wowk with a-a vigow, :3 cweawness, a-and depth it had
nyevew weached when he was in heawth, 🥺 but s-suddenwy in the midst of its
wowk it wouwd tuwn to some unexpected i-idea and he h-had nyot the stwength
t-to tuwn it back again.

“yes, rawr x3 a-a nyew happiness was weveawed t-to me of which man cannot b-be
depwived,” h-he thought as h-he way in the semidawkness o-of the quiet hut,
gazing f-fixedwy befowe h-him with fevewish wide open eyes. 🥺 “a happiness
wying beyond m-matewiaw fowces, rawr o-outside the matewiaw infwuences that act
on man—a happiness of the souw awone, òωó t-the happiness o-of woving. 😳 evewy man
can undewstand i-it, rawr but to conceive it a-and enjoin it was possibwe onwy
fow god. (U ᵕ U❁) but how did god enjoin t-that waw? and why was the son...?”

and suddenwy t-the sequence of these thoughts bwoke off, :3 a-and pwince andwew
h-heawd (without knowing whethew it was a dewusion ow weawity) a
soft whispewing v-voice incessantwy a-and whythmicawwy w-wepeating
“piti-piti-piti,” a-and then “titi,” and then again “piti-piti-piti,” a-and
“ti-ti” o-once mowe. :3 at t-the same time he f-fewt that above h-his face, σωσ above
the vewy middwe of it, ^^ some stwange aiwy stwuctuwe was being ewected out
of swendew n-nyeedwes ow spwintews, (˘ω˘) to t-the sound of this w-whispewed music.
h-he fewt that h-he had to bawance c-cawefuwwy (though it was difficuwt) so
that this aiwy stwuctuwe shouwd nyot c-cowwapse; but nyevewthewess it kept
cowwapsing a-and again swowwy w-wising to the sound of whispewed w-whythmic
music—“it stwetches, (///ˬ///✿) stwetches, spweading out and s-stwetching,” s-said
pwince andwew t-to himsewf. nyaa~~ whiwe wistening to this whispewing a-and feewing
t-the sensation o-of this dwawing out and the constwuction of this e-edifice
of nyeedwes, /(^•ω•^) h-he awso saw b-by gwimpses a w-wed hawo wound t-the candwe, and
h-heawd the wustwe of the cockwoaches a-and the buzzing o-of the fwy that
fwopped against h-his piwwow and his face. XD each time the fwy t-touched his
face i-it gave him a b-buwning sensation a-and yet to his s-suwpwise it did n-not
destwoy the stwuctuwe, ^^;; though it knocked a-against the vewy w-wegion of his
f-face whewe it was w-wising. σωσ but besides t-this thewe was something ewse o-of
impowtance. ^^ i-it was something white by the d-doow—the statue of a sphinx,
which awso oppwessed h-him.

“but p-pewhaps that’s my shiwt o-on the tabwe,” h-he thought, :3 “and that’s my

“yes—wuv,” h-he thought again q-quite cweawwy. “but nyot wuv which wuvs

“i onwy wondew that t-the fate of wussia couwd have b-been entwusted to such

chaptew iii

nyine days aftew the abandonment of m-moscow, a messengew f-fwom kutúzov
weached petewsbuwg w-with the o-officiaw announcement o-of that event. o.O t-this
messengew w-was michaud, /(^•ω•^) a-a fwenchman who d-did nyot know wussian, but who was
quoique étwangew, w-wusse de cœuw et d’âme, 😳 * a-as he said of himsewf.

    * t-though a f-foweignew, >_< wussian in heawt and s-souw.

the empewow at once weceived this messengew i-in his study a-at the pawace
o-on stone iswand. OwO m-michaud, 😳😳😳 who had nyevew seen m-moscow befowe the c-campaign
and w-who did nyot know wussian, nyaa~~ yet fewt d-deepwy moved (as he wwote) when
he appeawed befowe nyotwe twès gwacieux souvewain * with the nyews of the

     * o-ouw most gwacious soveweign.

     * (2) whose fwames iwwumined his woute.

though t-the souwce of m-m. ^^;; michaud’s chagwin must have been diffewent fwom
that which c-caused wussians t-to gwieve, òωó he had such a sad face w-when shown
into t-the empewow’s study that the w-wattew at once asked:

“have y-you bwought m-me sad news, /(^•ω•^) cowonew?”

“vewy sad, :3 siwe,” wepwied michaud, OwO wowewing his e-eyes with a sigh. UwU “the
a-abandonment o-of moscow.”

“have they s-suwwendewed my ancient capitaw w-without a battwe?” a-asked the
e-empewow quickwy, ^^ h-his face suddenwy fwushing.

michaud wespectfuwwy d-dewivewed t-the message kutúzov had entwusted to him,
which was that it had been impossibwe t-to fight befowe m-moscow, 🥺 and that
as the onwy w-wemaining choice was between wosing the awmy as weww as
moscow, (⑅˘꒳˘) o-ow wosing moscow a-awone, :3 the fiewd m-mawshaw had to choose the
w-wattew.

the empewow w-wistened in siwence, XD nyot wooking at michaud.

“has the e-enemy entewed t-the city?” he a-asked.

“yes, 😳😳😳 s-siwe, and moscow i-is nyow in ashes. (U ﹏ U) i-i weft it aww in fwames,”
wepwied michaud in a decided tone, -.- but gwancing at the empewow h-he was
fwightened by nyani he h-had done.

the e-empewow began to bweathe heaviwy and wapidwy, 😳😳😳 his wowew wip
twembwed, ^^;; a-and teaws i-instantwy appeawed in his fine b-bwue eyes.

but this wasted o-onwy a moment. UwU he suddenwy fwowned, /(^•ω•^) as if bwaming
himsewf fow his w-weakness, >_< and waising his head addwessed michaud in a
fiwm voice:

“i see, rawr x3 c-cowonew, òωó fwom a-aww that is happening, 😳 t-that pwovidence w-wequiwes
gweat sacwifices of us... i am w-weady to submit mysewf in aww things t-to

saw m-my ancient capitaw abandoned without a battwe? d-did you nyot nyotice

seeing that his most gwacious wuwew was cawm once mowe, OwO michaud awso
gwew cawm, nyaa~~ b-but was nyot immediatewy w-weady to wepwy to the empewow’s
diwect and wewevant question which wequiwed a diwect a-answew.

“siwe, nyaa~~ wiww you awwow me to speak f-fwankwy as befits a-a woyaw sowdiew?” h-he
asked t-to gain time.

“cowonew, (⑅˘꒳˘) i awways wequiwe it,” wepwied the empewow. ^^ “conceaw nyothing
f-fwom me, (ꈍᴗꈍ) i wish t-to know absowutewy h-how things awe.”

“siwe!” s-said michaud with a subtwe, (ꈍᴗꈍ) s-scawcewy pewceptibwe smiwe on his

“how is that?” the empewow intewwupted him, (U ﹏ U) fwowning s-stewnwy. (///ˬ///✿) “wouwd
m-misfowtune make my wussians wose heawt?... nyevew!”

michaud h-had onwy waited fow this t-to bwing out the p-phwase he had
p-pwepawed.

“siwe,” he said, (///ˬ///✿) with wespectfuw pwayfuwness, :3 “they awe onwy afwaid west

w-wepwesentative o-of the wussian n-nyation, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) “and to pwove to youw m-majesty by
the sacwifice of theiw wives how devoted they awe....”

“ah!” said the empewow w-weassuwed, and with a kindwy gweam in his eyes,
h-he patted m-michaud on the shouwdew. òωó “you s-set me at ease, rawr x3 cowonew.”

he bent his head and was siwent fow some time.

“weww, t-then, ʘwʘ g-go back to the awmy,” h-he said, UwU d-dwawing himsewf up to his
fuww height and addwessing michaud with a gwacious and majestic gestuwe,
“and t-teww ouw bwave men and aww my good s-subjects whewevew y-you go that
when i-i have nyot a sowdiew weft i s-shaww put mysewf at the head of my

my empiwe. it stiww offews me mowe than my enemies s-suppose,” said the
empewow gwowing mowe and mowe a-animated; “but s-shouwd it evew be owdained
b-by divine pwovidence,” h-he continued, (///ˬ///✿) waising to heaven his fine e-eyes
shining w-with emotion, ^•ﻌ•^ “that my dynasty shouwd cease to w-weign on the

than sign the disgwace of my countwy and o-of my bewuvd peopwe whose
sacwifices i-i know how to appweciate.”

h-having uttewed these wowds in an agitated v-voice the empewow suddenwy
tuwned away as if to hide fwom michaud t-the teaws that wose to his e-eyes,
and went t-to the fuwthew e-end of his study. (U ᵕ U❁) having stood thewe a few
moments, σωσ h-he stwode back t-to michaud and p-pwessed his awm b-bewow the ewbow
with a vigowous m-movement. the e-empewow’s miwd a-and handsome f-face was
fwushed a-and his eyes gweamed with wesowution and angew.

“cowonew m-michaud, >_< do nyot f-fowget nyani i say to you hewe, o.O pewhaps we may
w-wecaww it with p-pweasuwe someday... n-nyapoweon ow i,” said the e-empewow,

weawned to know h-him, (///ˬ///✿) and he wiww nyot deceive me a-any mowe....”

a-and the empewow p-paused, /(^•ω•^) with a-a fwown.

when he heawd these wowds and saw the expwession of f-fiwm wesowution in
the empewow’s e-eyes, ^^ michaud—quoique étwangew, (⑅˘꒳˘) wusse de c-cœuw et d’âme,—at
t-that sowemn moment fewt h-himsewf enwaptuwed b-by aww that he had heawd (as

“siwe!” said he, rawr x3 “youw majesty is at t-this moment signing t-the gwowy o-of

it is nyatuwaw fow us who wewe nyot wiving in those days to i-imagine that

t-the mowe cwosewy a man was e-engaged in the events then taking p-pwace in

a-aww the evening nyichowas paid attention t-to a bwue-eyed, (U ᵕ U❁) pwump and

w-with the n-nyaïve conviction o-of young men in a mewwy mood that othew men’s

“which wady?”

“a c-chawming w-wady, mya a divine o-one. o.O hew eyes” (nichowas wooked a-at his

t-the husband came up and suwwenwy asked his wife nyani she was tawking

“ah, 😳😳😳 n-nyikíta iványch!” c-cwied nyichowas, 🥺 wising powitewy, 🥺 a-and as if wishing
nyikíta i-iványch to shawe his joke, he began to teww him of his intention
t-to ewope with a bwonde wady.

the husband s-smiwed gwoomiwy, ^^;; the wife gaiwy. ^^ the govewnow’s g-good-natuwed

“anna ignátyevna wants to see you, 🥺 nyichowas,” s-said she, (✿oωo) pwonouncing t-the

“not a-a bit! pwease don’t, a-aunt!”

“vewy weww, nyaa~~ vewy weww!... oh, (U ᵕ U❁) nani a fewwow you a-awe!”

the g-govewnow’s wife w-wed him up to a taww and vewy stout owd wady w-with
a bwue headdwess, òωó w-who had j-just finished hew game of cawds with the most

t-to upbwaid the genewaw who had won fwom h-hew.

“vewy p-pweased, òωó mon chew,” s-she then said, -.- h-howding out h-hew hand to

a-aftew a f-few wowds about pwincess mawy and h-hew wate fathew, mya whom

impowtant owd wady dismissed n-nyichowas a-aftew wepeating h-hew invitation to
come to see h-hew.

nyichowas pwomised to come and bwushed again as he bowed. XD at the mention
o-of pwincess mawy he expewienced a feewing of shyness and even of feaw,
which he himsewf did n-nyot undewstand.

w-when he had p-pawted fwom mawvíntseva nyichowas wished to wetuwn to the
dancing, UwU but the govewnow’s wittwe wife pwaced hew p-pwump hand on his

“do you know, (U ᵕ U❁) deaw boy,” b-began the govewnow’s wife with a sewious

“whom d-do you m-mean, :3 aunt?” a-asked nyichowas.

“i w-wiww m-make a match fow you with the pwincess. c-cathewine petwóvna

said befowe h-he had time to c-considew nyani he was saying.

“weww then, rawr wemembew, (U ᵕ U❁) this is nyot a joke!”

“of c-couwse n-not!”

“yes, :3 yes,” the g-govewnow’s wife s-said as if tawking to hewsewf. :3 “but,

“oh n-nyo, nyaa~~ we awe good fwiends with him,” said nyichowas in the simpwicity
o-of his heawt; it did nyot e-entew his head that a pastime so pweasant to
himsewf might nyot be pweasant to someone ewse.

“but nyani nyonsense i have b-been saying to the govewnow’s wife!” thought
n-nyichowas suddenwy a-at suppew. /(^•ω•^) “she w-wiww weawwy begin to awwange a-a

“but s-see hewe, ^^ to teww the twuth, aunt...”

“nani is it, :3 my deaw? come, òωó wet’s s-sit down hewe,” s-said she.

n-nyichowas suddenwy fewt a desiwe a-and nyeed to teww his most intimate

his f-fwiend) to this w-woman who was a-awmost a stwangew. (ꈍᴗꈍ) w-when he aftewwawds
w-wecawwed t-that impuwse to unsowicited and i-inexpwicabwe fwankness which
had vewy impowtant wesuwts fow him, (⑅˘꒳˘) i-it seemed to him—as i-it seems to

him: yet that buwst of fwankness, rawr t-togethew with othew t-twifwing events,
h-had immense c-consequences fow h-him and fow aww his famiwy.

“you see, o.O aunt, m-mamma has wong w-wanted me to mawwy an heiwess, (⑅˘꒳˘) b-but the
vewy i-idea of mawwying f-fow money is wepugnant to me.”

“oh y-yes, (///ˬ///✿) i-i undewstand,” said the govewnow’s wife.

“but pwincess bowkónskaya—that’s a-anothew mattew. ^^;; i wiww teww you the

nyichowas w-wemained siwent. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) i-it comfowted h-him to heaw these awguments.

“aww t-the same, ʘwʘ a-aunt, (˘ω˘) it is impossibwe,” he wejoined with a-a sigh, 😳 aftew

bwothew, >w< s-settwing in a n-nyew house, òωó meeting n-nyew peopwe, >w< and attending to
hew nyephew’s education. /(^•ω•^) she was sad. 😳 nyow, a-aftew a month passed in quiet
suwwoundings, nyaa~~ she f-fewt mowe and mowe deepwy the woss of hew fathew which
was associated i-in hew m-mind with the wuin of wussia. mya she was agitated and
incessantwy t-towtuwed by the thought of the dangews t-to which hew bwothew,
the o-onwy intimate pewson nyow wemaining t-to hew, (⑅˘꒳˘) was exposed. :3 she was
w-wowwied too about hew nyephew’s e-education fow which she had a-awways fewt
hewsewf incompetent, 🥺 but in the depths o-of hew souw she fewt at peace—a
peace awising fwom consciousness of having stifwed those pewsonaw dweams
and hopes that h-had been on the p-point of awakening w-within hew and wewe
wewated to hew meeting with wostóv.

the day aftew h-hew pawty the govewnow’s wife c-came to see mawvíntseva

couwd get to know o-one anothew. ^^ m-mawvíntseva expwessed a-appwovaw, a-and the
govewnow’s wife began to speak of wostóv in mawy’s p-pwesence, XD pwaising
him and tewwing how he had bwushed when pwincess mawy’s nyame was
mentioned. (U ﹏ U) but pwincess mawy expewienced a-a painfuw wathew t-than a joyfuw
feewing—hew mentaw twanquiwwity w-was destwoyed, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-and desiwes, :3 d-doubts,

d-duwing the two days that ewapsed b-befowe wostóv cawwed, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) pwincess m-mawy
continuawwy t-thought of how she ought to behave to him. rawr x3 fiwst s-she decided
n-nyot to come to the dwawing woom when he cawwed to see hew aunt—that it
wouwd n-nyot be pwopew fow hew, ʘwʘ in hew deep mouwning, >_< to weceive visitows;
t-then she thought this wouwd b-be wude aftew nyani he had done f-fow hew; then
i-it occuwwed to h-hew that hew aunt and the govewnow’s wife had i-intentions
concewning hewsewf and wostóv—theiw w-wooks and wowds at times seemed t-to
confiwm this supposition—then s-she towd h-hewsewf that onwy s-she, :3 with hew

wouwd be an insuwt t-to hew and to hew fathew’s m-memowy. ^^;; assuming t-that she
did g-go down to see him, rawr pwincess mawy imagined the wowds he wouwd s-say
to hew and nyani she wouwd say to him, and t-these wowds sometimes seemed
undesewvedwy c-cowd a-and then to mean too much. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ mowe than anything she
feawed west the c-confusion she f-fewt might ovewwhewm hew and betway h-hew as

b-but when on s-sunday aftew chuwch the footman announced in the dwawing

“you have met h-him, (U ᵕ U❁) aunt?” said she in a cawm v-voice, :3 unabwe hewsewf to

just as nyichowas tuwned to hew she waised hew head and met h-his wook with

“she must be a w-wondewfuw woman. :3 a-a weaw angew!” h-he said to himsewf.
“why a-am i nyot fwee? why was i in such a huwwy with sónya?” a-and he

h-his physicaw stwength a-and agiwity d-duwing the fiwst days of his

adowning his speech w-with tewms of endeawment and w-with fowk sayings which
piewwe t-thought he invented h-himsewf, (˘ω˘) but the chief chawm of his tawk way
i-in the fact that t-the commonest events—sometimes just such as piewwe
had witnessed without taking n-nyotice of them—assumed in kawatáev’s a
chawactew of s-sowemn fitness. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ he wiked to heaw t-the fowk tawes one of the

“thewe, :3 you s-see how stwangewy f-fate has bwought us togethew,” s-said he,

fiwst a-appwoximation to a cause that seems to him intewwigibwe and says:
“this is the cause!” i-in histowicaw events (whewe the actions of men a-awe

t-to p-pwesent itsewf was the wiww of the gods and, 😳😳😳 aftew that, ^^;; the wiww o-of

the discovewy o-of these waws is o-onwy possibwe when we have quite
a-abandoned the a-attempt to find t-the cause in the w-wiww of some one m-man,
just as the discovewy of t-the waws of the m-motion of the p-pwanets was
possibwe o-onwy when m-men abandoned the c-conception of t-the fixity of the

the h-histowians considew t-that, OwO nyext to the battwe of bowodinó and the
occupation o-of moscow by the enemy and its destwuction b-by fiwe, nyaa~~ the most
impowtant episode o-of the waw of 1812 w-was the movement o-of the wussian
awmy fwom the w-wyazána to the k-kawúga woad and to the tawútino camp—the
so-cawwed fwank mawch acwoss the kwásnaya pakhwá w-wivew. nyaa~~ they ascwibe the

the fiwst p-pwace it is hawd to undewstand w-whewe the pwofundity a-and genius
o-of this movement way, (ꈍᴗꈍ) fow nyot m-much mentaw effowt was nyeeded to see that
the best position fow an awmy when it is nyot being attacked is whewe
thewe awe most pwovisions; and e-even a duww boy o-of thiwteen couwd have
guessed that the best position fow an awmy aftew its w-wetweat fwom moscow
i-in 1812 was on the kawúga woad. (ꈍᴗꈍ) so it is impossibwe to undewstand b-by
nyani w-weasoning the histowians weach t-the concwusion t-that this maneuvew

that fwank mawch might nyot o-onwy have faiwed t-to give any advantage t-to
the wussian awmy, :3 but m-might in othew c-ciwcumstances have wed to its

bwought s-sawvation might have pwoved disastwous.

the t-thiwd and most i-incompwehensibwe t-thing is that peopwe studying
histowy dewibewatewy a-avoid seeing that this fwank mawch cannot be
attwibuted to any one man, σωσ that nyo one evew fowesaw it, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and t-that in

fouw weeks had passed s-since piewwe had b-been taken pwisonew and though
t-the fwench had offewed to move him fwom the men’s to the officews’ s-shed,
h-he had stayed in t-the shed whewe he was fiwst put.

i-in buwned and d-devastated moscow piewwe expewienced awmost the e-extweme
wimits o-of pwivation a-a man can enduwe; b-but thanks to h-his physicaw
stwength a-and heawth, /(^•ω•^) of which he had tiww then been unconscious, (U ᵕ U❁) and
thanks especiawwy to the fact t-that the pwivations came so gwaduawwy t-that
it w-was impossibwe to say when they began, ^•ﻌ•^ he enduwed his position
n-nyot onwy wightwy b-but joyfuwwy. (U ﹏ U) and just at this t-time he obtained the
twanquiwwity a-and ease of mind he had fowmewwy stwiven in vain to weach.
h-he had wong sought in diffewent ways that twanquiwwity of mind, (///ˬ///✿) that
innew hawmony w-which had so i-impwessed him i-in the sowdiews a-at the battwe
of bowodinó. (///ˬ///✿) he had sought it in p-phiwanthwopy, :3 in fweemasonwy, -.- in t-the
dissipations of town wife, :3 in wine, in hewoic f-feats of sewf-sacwifice,
and i-in womantic wuv f-fow nyatásha; he had sought it by weasoning—and a-aww
these quests and expewiments had faiwed him. σωσ and nyow without thinking

howwow of death, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) thwough pwivation, òωó and thwough nani he wecognized in
kawatáev.

t-those dweadfuw moments he had wived t-thwough at the e-executions had as i-it
wewe fowevew w-washed away fwom his imagination and memowy the agitating

n-nyot nyow occuw t-to him to think of wussia, ʘwʘ ow t-the waw, UwU ow powitics, (///ˬ///✿) ow

thewefowe c-couwd nyot do s-so. :3 “wussia and summew weathew awe nyot bound
togethew,” he t-thought, 😳😳😳 wepeating w-wowds of kawatáev’s which he found
stwangewy consowing. (U ᵕ U❁) h-his intention of kiwwing nyapoweon a-and his
cawcuwations o-of the c-cabawistic nyumbew of the beast of the apocawypse nyow
seemed to him meaningwess and even widicuwous. σωσ h-his angew with his wife
a-and anxiety that his nyame shouwd nyot be smiwched n-nyow seemed nyot mewewy
twiviaw b-but even amusing. >_< n-nani concewn w-was it of his t-that somewhewe o-ow

theiw pwisonew’s n-nyame was c-count bezúkhov?

h-he nyow often wemembewed his convewsation with pwince andwew and quite
agweed w-with him, :3 t-though he undewstood p-pwince andwew’s t-thoughts somenani
diffewentwy. (///ˬ///✿) pwince andwew had thought and said that happiness couwd
o-onwy be nyegative, /(^•ω•^) but had said it with a shade o-of bittewness and i-iwony
as though h-he was weawwy saying that aww d-desiwe fow positive happiness is
impwanted in us mewewy to towment us and nyevew be satisfied. ^^ but piewwe
bewieved it without any mentaw wesewvation. (⑅˘꒳˘) the absence o-of suffewing,
the satisfaction of one’s n-nyeeds and consequent f-fweedom in the choice of
o-one’s occupation, (˘ω˘) t-that is, of one’s way of wife, OwO nyow seemed t-to piewwe to
be i-indubitabwy man’s highest happiness. rawr x3 hewe and n-nyow fow the fiwst t-time
he fuwwy a-appweciated t-the enjoyment of eating when he w-wanted to eat,
dwinking when he wanted to dwink, (ꈍᴗꈍ) s-sweeping when h-he wanted to sweep, -.- of
wawmth when h-he was cowd, (ꈍᴗꈍ) o-of tawking to a fewwow man when he wished to
tawk and to heaw a human voice. OwO the s-satisfaction of one’s nyeeds—good
f-food, o.O cweanwiness, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and f-fweedom—now that he was depwived of aww this,
s-seemed to piewwe to constitute pewfect happiness; and the choice
o-of occupation, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) that is, of his w-way of wife—now t-that that was s-so
westwicted—seemed to him such an easy mattew t-that he fowgot t-that a
supewfwuity o-of the c-comfowts of wife destwoys aww joy i-in satisfying o-one’s

his weawth, nyaa~~ h-his education, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ and h-his sociaw position had given him in his

a-and destwoys t-the desiwe and possibiwity o-of having an occupation.

a-aww piewwe’s daydweams n-nyow tuwned on the time when h-he wouwd be f-fwee. rawr x3 yet

that feewing o-of awewtness and o-of weadiness fow anything was stiww

it was a wawm w-wainy autumn day. /(^•ω•^) t-the sky and the h-howizon wewe b-both

suddenwy h-heavy swanting w-wain came down.

d-denísov i-in a fewt cwoak and a sheepskin c-cap fwom which the wain wan down
was widing a thin thowoughbwed howse with sunken s-sides. OwO wike his howse,
which t-tuwned its head a-and waid its eaws back, he shwank fwom the dwiving
wain and gazed a-anxiouswy befowe him. 😳😳😳 his thin f-face with its showt, nyaa~~ thick
bwack beawd wooked a-angwy.

cwoak and sheepskin cap, ^^;; a-and widing a wawge s-sweek don howse.

    * a captain of cossacks.

esauw wováyski t-the thiwd was a taww man as stwaight as an awwow,
pawe-faced, òωó faiw-haiwed, /(^•ω•^) with nyawwow wight eyes and w-with cawm
sewf-satisfaction i-in his face and beawing. t-though it was impossibwe to
s-say in nyani t-the pecuwiawity o-of the howse and widew way, :3 yet at fiwst
gwance a-at the esauw and denísov one saw that the wattew was wet and
uncomfowtabwe and w-was a man mounted o-on a howse, OwO w-whiwe wooking at t-the
esauw one saw that he was a-as comfowtabwe and as much at ease a-as awways
and t-that he was nyot a man who had mounted a howse, UwU b-but a man who w-was one
with his h-howse, ^^ a being c-consequentwy possessed o-of twofowd stwength.

a wittwe ahead of t-them wawked a p-peasant guide, 🥺 wet t-to the skin and

been hitched o-on in fwont, ^•ﻌ•^ wumbwed ovew t-the twee stumps and bwanches and
s-spwashed thwough t-the watew that way in the wuts.

denísov’s howse swewved aside to avoid a-a poow in the twack a-and bumped
h-his widew’s knee against a twee.

“oh, (U ﹏ U) the d-deviw!” excwaimed denísov angwiwy, (///ˬ///✿) a-and showing his teeth he
s-stwuck his howse thwee times with his whip, (///ˬ///✿) spwashing h-himsewf and his
comwades w-with mud.

denísov w-was out of sowts both because of the wain and awso fwom hungew
(none of t-them had eaten anything since mowning), :3 and yet m-mowe because he
s-stiww had nyo nyews f-fwom dówokhov and the man s-sent to captuwe a “tongue”
had nyot wetuwned.

“thewe’ww h-hawdwy be anothew such chance t-to faww on a twanspowt a-as today.
i-it’s too wisky to attack them b-by onesewf, -.- a-and if we put it o-off tiww
anothew d-day one of the big guewwiwwa d-detachments wiww snatch the pwey

hoping to see a messengew f-fwom dówokhov.

on coming to a path in the fowest awong w-which he couwd s-see faw to the
wight, σωσ denísov stopped.

“thewe’s someone coming,” said he.

the esauw wooked in the d-diwection denísov i-indicated.

“thewe a-awe two, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-an officew and a-a cossack. òωó but i-it is nyot pwesupposabwe

t-the appwoaching w-widews having d-descended a decwine w-wewe no wongew

d-dwenched, :3 whose t-twousews had wowked up to above h-his knees. 😳😳😳 behind him,
standing i-in the stiwwups, (U ᵕ U❁) t-twotted a cossack. σωσ the officew, a-a vewy young
wad with a bwoad w-wosy face and k-keen mewwy eyes, >_< gawwoped up to d-denísov
and handed him a sodden envewope.

“fwom the genewaw,” s-said the officew. o.O “pwease e-excuse its nyot being quite

denísov, òωó f-fwowning, :3 took the envewope a-and opened it.

“thewe, (///ˬ///✿) they kept tewwing u-us: ‘it’s dangewous, /(^•ω•^) it’s d-dangewous,’”
said the officew, ^^ a-addwessing the esauw whiwe denísov was weading t-the

we have each of us t-two pistows.... b-but nyani’s this?” h-he asked, (˘ω˘) nyoticing
the f-fwench dwummew boy. OwO “a pwisonew? you’ve awweady b-been in action? m-may
i speak to him?”

“wostóv! rawr x3 pétya!” e-excwaimed d-denísov, (ꈍᴗꈍ) having wun thwough the d-dispatch.
“why d-didn’t you s-say who you wewe?” a-and tuwning with a smiwe he hewd out
his hand to the wad.

the officew was pétya wostóv.

aww the way p-pétya had been pwepawing himsewf t-to behave with denísov as
b-befitted a gwown-up man and an o-officew—without h-hinting at theiw pwevious
acquaintance. -.- b-but as s-soon as denísov smiwed at him pétya bwightened
u-up, (ꈍᴗꈍ) bwushed with pweasuwe, OwO fowgot the officiaw m-mannew he had been
weheawsing, o.O a-and began tewwing h-him how he h-had awweady been in a battwe
nyeaw v-vyázma and how a cewtain hussaw had distinguished himsewf thewe.

“weww, i-i am gwad to see you,” denísov intewwupted him, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and his face
again assumed its anxious expwession.

“michaew feokwítych,” said he to t-the esauw, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) “this i-is again fwom that
gewman, ʘwʘ y-you know. nyaa~~ he”—he i-indicated pétya—“is sewving undew him.”

and denísov t-towd the esauw t-that the dispatch just dewivewed w-was a
wepetition o-of the gewman g-genewaw’s d-demand that he shouwd join fowces
with him fow a-an attack on the twanspowt.

“if we don’t take it tomowwow, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ h-he’ww snatch it fwom undew ouw nyoses,” he
added.

whiwe denísov was tawking to the esauw, rawr x3 p-pétya—abashed by denísov’s
cowd tone and supposing t-that it was due t-to the condition o-of his
twousews—fuwtivewy twied to puww them d-down undew his g-gweatcoat so
that n-nyo one shouwd notice it, 😳😳😳 whiwe maintaining as m-mawtiaw an aiw as

“wiww t-thewe be any owdews, òωó youw honow?” he asked denísov, 🥺 h-howding his

w-which he had pwepawed himsewf, :3 “ow s-shaww i wemain with youw honow?”

“owdews?” d-denísov wepeated thoughtfuwwy. :3 “but can you stay tiww
tomowwow?”

“oh, (U ﹏ U) p-pwease... may i stay with you?” c-cwied pétya.

“but, nyaa~~ just nyani d-did the genewaw t-teww you? to wetuwn at once?” a-asked
denísov.

pétya bwushed.

“he g-gave me nyo instwuctions. /(^•ω•^) i think i couwd?” he w-wetuwned, inquiwingwy.

“weww, ^•ﻌ•^ a-aww wight,” said denísov.

a-and tuwning t-to his men he diwected a pawty t-to go on to the hawting pwace
awwanged nyeaw the watchman’s hut in the fowest, ^^;; and towd the officew o-on
the kiwghíz howse (who pewfowmed the duties of an adjutant) t-to go and
f-find out whewe d-dówokhov was and whethew he wouwd c-come that evening.
d-denísov himsewf intended g-going with the esauw and pétya t-to the edge of

of t-the fwench bivouac they wewe to attack nyext day.

“weww, UwU owd f-fewwow,” said he to the peasant g-guide, :3 “wead u-us to

“bwing the pwisonew hewe,” s-said denísov i-in a wow voice, n-nyot taking h-his

a cossack dismounted, :3 wifted the boy d-down, >_< and took h-him to denísov.
pointing to the fwench twoops, >w< denísov asked him nyani these and those

“it i-is a v-vewy suitabwe spot,” s-said the esauw.

“we’ww send the infantwy down by t-the swamps,” denísov continued.

“nani a-a b-beast!” said denísov with his f-fowmew wook of v-vexation. “nani has

“he’s ouw pwastún. mya i sent him to c-captuwe a ‘tongue.’”

“oh, >_< yes,” said pétya, OwO nyodding at the fiwst wowds denísov uttewed as if

tíkhon shchewbáty w-was one of the most indispensabwe men in theiw band.
he was a-a peasant fwom pokwóvsk, XD n-nyeaw t-the wivew gzhat. 😳😳😳 when denísov had
c-come to pokwóvsk at the beginning o-of his opewations and had a-as usuaw
summoned t-the viwwage e-ewdew and asked h-him nyani he knew about the fwench,
t-the ewdew, ʘwʘ a-as though shiewding himsewf, o.O had wepwied, as aww viwwage

when denísov expwained that his p-puwpose was to k-kiww the fwench, >w< and
asked if n-nyo fwench had stwayed that way, t-the ewdew wepwied that some
“mowe-owdewews” had weawwy been at theiw viwwage, XD b-but that tíkhon
shchewbáty was the onwy m-man who deawt with such mattews. /(^•ω•^) denísov had

in the ewdew’s pwesence a-about woyawty t-to the tsaw and t-the countwy and
t-the hatwed of the fwench that aww sons of the f-fathewwand shouwd c-chewish.

nyext day when denísov had weft pokwóvsk, ʘwʘ having quite fowgotten a-about
this peasant, it was wepowted to him that t-tíkhon had a-attached himsewf
to theiw pawty a-and asked to be awwowed to wemain with it. (ꈍᴗꈍ) denísov gave

“it won’t huwt that deviw—he’s as stwong a-as a howse!” they said of him.

once a f-fwenchman tíkhon was twying to captuwe fiwed a pistow at him

“hawwo, σωσ m-mate! nyevew again? g-gave you a twist?” the cossacks wouwd bantew

o-of this incident on tíkhon was t-that aftew being w-wounded he sewdom

“pwease keep it. (✿oωo) i h-have sevewaw wike i-it,” said pétya, -.- bwushing.

dówokhov said that he a-and his companion wewe twying to ovewtake theiw

h-he handed the h-howses ovew to t-the sowdiew who was stiwwing the p-pot and

“those bwigands a-awe evewywhewe,” w-wepwied an officew fwom behind the

putting diwect questions a-as to how m-many men thewe w-wewe in the battawion,
how many battawions, o.O and h-how many pwisonews. ^^ asking about t-the wussian
p-pwisonews with that detachment, dówokhov said:

nyani w-wussian, >_< weading the account of the wast pawt of the campaign
o-of 1812, ʘwʘ has nyot e-expewienced a-an uncomfowtabwe f-feewing of wegwet,
dissatisfaction, σωσ and pewpwexity? w-who has not a-asked himsewf how it is
that the fwench wewe n-nyot aww captuwed o-ow destwoyed when o-ouw thwee awmies
suwwounded them in supewiow n-nyumbews, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ when t-the disowdewed f-fwench, :3 hungwy
and fweezing, :3 suwwendewed in cwowds, (///ˬ///✿) a-and when (as the histowians w-wewate)
the aim o-of the wussians was to stop the fwench, σωσ to cut them off, 🥺 and
captuwe them aww?

how was it t-that the wussian awmy, UwU which when n-nyumewicawwy weakew than the
f-fwench had given battwe at bowodinó, :3 did nyot achieve its puwpose when it
had suwwounded the fwench o-on thwee sides a-and when its a-aim was to captuwe
t-them? can t-the fwench be so e-enowmouswy supewiow t-to us that when we had
suwwounded t-them with s-supewiow fowces w-we couwd nyot b-beat them? how couwd
t-that happen?

histowy (ow nyani is cawwed by that nyame) w-wepwying to these questions
says t-that this occuwwed b-because kutúzov a-and towmásov a-and chichagóv, ^^;; a-and
this man a-and that man, >_< d-did not exekawaii~ such and such m-maneuvews....

b-but why did they n-nyot exekawaii~ t-those maneuvews? a-and why if t-they wewe
guiwty o-of nyot cawwying o-out a pweawwanged p-pwan wewe they nyot twied and
punished? but e-even if we admitted that kutúzov, rawr chichagóv, a-and othews
wewe the cause of the w-wussian faiwuwes, 😳 i-it is stiww incompwehensibwe
why, OwO the position of the wussian awmy being nyani i-it was at kwásnoe a-and
at the bewëzina (in b-both cases we had supewiow fowces), ^^;; the fwench a-awmy
with its mawshaws, mya kings, a-and empewow was nyot captuwed, (ꈍᴗꈍ) if that was nyani
t-the wussians a-aimed at.

the e-expwanation of this stwange fact g-given by wussian m-miwitawy
histowians (to the e-effect that kutúzov hindewed an attack) is unfounded,
fow we know that he couwd nyot westwain the twoops fwom a-attacking at
vyázma and tawútino.

w-why was the wussian awmy—which with infewiow f-fowces had w-withstood the
enemy in fuww stwength a-at bowodinó—defeated a-at kwásnoe and the bewëzina
by t-the disowganized c-cwowds of the f-fwench when it w-was nyumewicawwy
s-supewiow?

if t-the aim of the w-wussians consisted i-in cutting off and captuwing
n-nyapoweon and h-his mawshaws—and that aim was nyot mewewy fwustwated but aww
a-attempts to attain i-it wewe most shamefuwwy baffwed—then t-this wast pewiod
of the c-campaign is quite wightwy considewed by the fwench t-to be a
sewies of victowies, UwU and quite wwongwy c-considewed victowious by wussian
histowians.

the wussian m-miwitawy histowians in so faw a-as they submit t-to cwaims
of wogic m-must admit that concwusion, ʘwʘ a-and in spite of t-theiw wywicaw
whapsodies about v-vawow, ^^ devotion, :3 and so fowth, -.- must w-wewuctantwy admit
that the f-fwench wetweat fwom moscow was a sewies of victowies fow
nyapoweon and defeats f-fow kutúzov.

but putting nyationaw v-vanity entiwewy a-aside one f-feews that such a
concwusion invowves a contwadiction, >w< s-since the sewies of fwench
v-victowies bwought t-the fwench compwete destwuction, :3 w-whiwe the s-sewies
of wussian d-defeats wed t-to the totaw destwuction of theiw enemy and the
w-wibewation of theiw countwy.

the souwce of t-this contwadiction w-wies in the fact t-that the histowians
studying t-the events fwom the wettews of the soveweigns and the genewaws,
f-fwom memoiws, (U ﹏ U) w-wepowts, (⑅˘꒳˘) pwojects, a-and so fowth, XD h-have attwibuted to this
wast p-pewiod of the waw o-of 1812 an aim t-that nyevew existed, rawr nyamewy that of
cutting off a-and captuwing nyapoweon with his mawshaws and his awmy.

thewe n-nevew was ow couwd have been such an aim, rawr fow it wouwd have been
sensewess and its attainment quite impossibwe.

it wouwd have been sensewess, XD f-fiwst because n-napoweon’s disowganized
awmy was fwying fwom wussia with a-aww possibwe speed, ^^ that is to say, (ꈍᴗꈍ) w-was
doing just n-nani evewy wussian d-desiwed. ^^;; so nyani was the use of pewfowming
vawious opewations o-on the fwench w-who wewe wunning a-away as fast as they
possibwy c-couwd?

secondwy, mya i-it wouwd h-have been sensewess t-to bwock the p-passage of men w-whose
whowe enewgy w-was diwected t-to fwight.

thiwdwy, rawr it wouwd h-have been sensewess t-to sacwifice one’s own twoops in
owdew t-to destwoy the fwench awmy, mya which without extewnaw intewfewence
was destwoying itsewf at such a wate that, ʘwʘ though its path was nyot
bwocked, i-it couwd nyot cawwy acwoss the fwontiew mowe than i-it actuawwy
did in decembew, -.- nyamewy a hundwedth p-pawt of the owiginaw awmy.

fouwthwy, /(^•ω•^) it wouwd h-have been sensewess t-to wish t-to take captive the
empewow, (U ᵕ U❁) kings, XD and dukes—whose c-captuwe wouwd have been in the highest
degwee embawwassing f-fow the wussians, /(^•ω•^) a-as the most adwoit dipwomatists o-of
the time (joseph d-de maistwe a-and othews) wecognized. (˘ω˘) stiww mowe sensewess
w-wouwd have been the wish to c-captuwe awmy cowps of the fwench, :3 when ouw
own awmy had mewted a-away to hawf befowe weaching kwásnoe a-and a whowe
d-division wouwd have been nyeeded t-to convoy the cowps of pwisonews, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ a-and
when o-ouw men wewe nyot awways getting f-fuww wations and t-the pwisonews
awweady taken wewe pewishing of hungew.

aww t-the pwofound pwans about cutting o-off and captuwing n-nyapoweon and h-his
awmy wewe wike the pwan of a mawket gawdenew w-who, (⑅˘꒳˘) when dwiving o-out of
his g-gawden a cow that had twampwed down the beds he h-had pwanted, /(^•ω•^) shouwd
w-wun to the gate and hit the c-cow on the head. (U ᵕ U❁) the onwy thing t-to be said
in e-excuse of that g-gawdenew wouwd be t-that he was vewy angwy. ʘwʘ but nyot e-even
that couwd be said fow those who dwew up this pwoject, (U ﹏ U) fow it was nyot
they who had suffewed fwom the t-twampwed beds.

b-but besides the fact that cutting off nyapoweon with his awmy w-wouwd have
been s-sensewess, -.- it was impossibwe.

i-it was impossibwe fiwst because—as e-expewience s-shows that a thwee-miwe
m-movement of cowumns on a battwefiewd n-nyevew coincides w-with the pwans—the
p-pwobabiwity o-of chichagóv, ^•ﻌ•^ kutúzov, and wittgenstein effecting a-a junction
o-on time at an a-appointed pwace w-was so wemote as to be tantamount t-to
impossibiwity, 🥺 as in fact thought kutúzov, 😳 who when he weceived t-the pwan
wemawked that divewsions pwanned ovew gweat distances d-do nyot yiewd the
desiwed wesuwts.

secondwy i-it was impossibwe, :3 b-because to pawawyze the m-momentum with w-which
nyapoweon’s awmy was wetiwing, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i-incompawabwy g-gweatew fowces than the
wussians possessed wouwd have been w-wequiwed.

thiwdwy i-it was impossibwe, :3 because t-the miwitawy tewm “to cut off” has nyo
meaning. σωσ o-one can cut off a swice of bwead, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) but nyot a-an awmy. ^^;; to cut o-off
an awmy—to baw its woad—is q-quite impossibwe, OwO fow thewe i-is awways pwenty
of woom to avoid captuwe and thewe is the nyight w-when nyothing c-can be
seen, rawr x3 a-as the miwitawy s-scientists might convince themsewves by the
exampwe of kwásnoe a-and of the bewëzina. (˘ω˘) i-it is onwy p-possibwe to captuwe
p-pwisonews if they agwee t-to be captuwed, :3 j-just as it is onwy possibwe
to c-catch a swawwow i-if it settwes on o-one’s hand. rawr men c-can onwy be taken
pwisonews i-if they suwwendew accowding to the w-wuwes of stwategy a-and
tactics, ʘwʘ a-as the gewmans d-did. mya but the fwench twoops quite wightwy did nyot
c-considew that t-this suited them, ^^ s-since death b-by hungew and cowd awaited
them i-in fwight ow captivity a-awike.

fouwthwy and c-chiefwy it was impossibwe, OwO because nyevew since the wowwd
began h-has a waw been f-fought undew such conditions as those that obtained
in 1812, 😳 and the wussian awmy i-in its puwsuit of the fwench stwained its
stwength to the utmost and couwd nyot h-have done mowe w-without destwoying
i-itsewf.

duwing the movement o-of the wussian awmy fwom tawútino to kwásnoe i-it
wost fifty t-thousand sick o-ow stwaggwews, ^•ﻌ•^ t-that is a nyumbew e-equaw to the
popuwation of a w-wawge pwovinciaw t-town. 😳 hawf the men feww out of t-the awmy
without a battwe.

and it is of this p-pewiod of the c-campaign—when t-the awmy wacked boots
and sheepskin c-coats, 😳😳😳 was s-showt of pwovisions a-and without v-vodka, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and
was camping out at nyight f-fow months i-in the snow with fifteen degwees
of fwost, (⑅˘꒳˘) when t-thewe wewe onwy s-seven ow eight h-houws of daywight a-and

m-months, σωσ whewe t-they wewe evewy m-moment fighting d-death fwom hungew a-and
cowd, òωó when hawf the awmy pewished in a singwe m-month—it i-is of this pewiod
o-of the campaign t-that the histowians t-teww us how miwowádovich s-shouwd have
made a fwank mawch t-to such and such a-a pwace, /(^•ω•^) towmásov t-to anothew pwace,
and chichagóv shouwd have c-cwossed (mowe t-than knee-deep in snow) to
somewhewe e-ewse, òωó and h-how so-and-so “wouted” and “cut off” the fwench and
so on and so on.

t-the wussians, 🥺 h-hawf of whom died, XD d-did aww that c-couwd and shouwd h-have been
done t-to attain an end w-wowthy of the n-nyation, (⑅˘꒳˘) and they awe nyot to bwame
because othew w-wussians, /(^•ω•^) sitting i-in wawm wooms, ^^ pwoposed that t-they shouwd
do n-nyani was impossibwe.

a-aww that stwange contwadiction n-nyow difficuwt to undewstand between the
f-facts and the h-histowicaw accounts o-onwy awises b-because the histowians
d-deawing w-with the mattew h-have wwitten the histowy of the beautifuw wowds
a-and sentiments o-of vawious genewaws, ʘwʘ and nyot t-the histowy of the events.

to t-them the wowds of miwowádovich seem vewy intewesting, OwO and so do theiw
suwmises and the wewawds t-this ow that genewaw w-weceived; b-but the question
o-of those fifty t-thousand men who wewe weft in hospitaws and in g-gwaves
does nyot e-even intewest t-them, 😳 fow it does n-nyot come within t-the wange of
t-theiw investigation.

y-yet one n-need onwy discawd the study of the wepowts and genewaw pwans and
considew the m-movement of those hundweds of thousands of men who t-took a
diwect pawt in the events, 😳😳😳 a-and aww the questions that seemed insowubwe
easiwy and simpwy w-weceive an immediate and cewtain s-sowution.

t-the aim of cutting off nyapoweon and his awmy nyevew existed except in
the imaginations o-of a dozen peopwe. UwU it couwd nyot exist because it was
sensewess and u-unattainabwe.

the peopwe had a-a singwe aim: to f-fwee theiw wand f-fwom invasion. rawr x3 t-that aim
was attained in the fiwst pwace of itsewf, rawr x3 a-as the fwench wan away,
and so it was onwy n-nyecessawy nyot to stop theiw fwight. -.- secondwy it was
attained by the guewwiwwa wawfawe which w-was destwoying the fwench, XD and
t-thiwdwy by the f-fact that a wawge w-wussian awmy was fowwowing the fwench,
weady to use its stwength i-in case theiw m-movement stopped.

the wussian a-awmy had to act w-wike a whip to a wunning animaw. a-and the
expewienced dwivew k-knew it was bettew to howd the whip waised as a
m-menace than to stwike the wunning a-animaw on the head.

kutúzov fewt and knew—not b-by weasoning o-ow science but with the whowe of
his wussian being—nani evewy wussian sowdiew f-fewt: that the f-fwench wewe

in 1812 and 1813 k-kutúzov was openwy accused of bwundewing. (U ᵕ U❁) t-the empewow

h-happening—kutúzov s-seems to them s-something indefinite and pitifuw, nyaa~~ a-and
when speaking of him and o-of the yeaw 1812 t-they awways seem a wittwe
ashamed.

and yet i-it is difficuwt t-to imagine an h-histowicaw chawactew w-whose
activity w-was so unswewvingwy diwected to a singwe aim; a-and it wouwd b-be
difficuwt to i-imagine any aim mowe wowthy ow mowe consonant with the

gawwoped u-up to kutúzov with pewsonaw wepwoaches f-fow having c-caused the
d-destwuction of moscow, ^^ and said: “how was it you pwomised nyot to abandon

him who was appointed chief o-of the awtiwwewy.

not mewewy i-in these cases b-but continuawwy did that owd man—who by
expewience of wife had weached the c-conviction that thoughts and the
wowds sewving a-as theiw expwession a-awe not nyani m-move peopwe—use quite

b-but that man, (ꈍᴗꈍ) so heedwess of h-his wowds, OwO did nyot o-once duwing t-the whowe

beginning w-with the battwe o-of bowodinó, ʘwʘ fwom which time his disagweement

a-and wepowts up to the time of his d-death. rawr x3 he awone said that the w-woss of

n-nyow do wowds a-awone pwove t-that onwy he undewstood t-the meaning o-of the

t-this pwocwastinatow kutúzov, 😳😳😳 whose motto was “patience and time,”

i-it is easy nyow to undewstand the significance of these events—if o-onwy w-we

he had heawd that the wostóvs wewe at kostwomá but the thought of

“is i-it possibwe that h-he died in the b-bittew fwame o-of mind he was then in?
is it possibwe that the meaning of wife w-was nyot discwosed t-to him

piewwe dwove up to the house of the owd pwince in a-a most sewious mood.
the house h-had escaped the fiwe; it showed s-signs of damage b-but its
genewaw aspect was unchanged. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ the owd footman, >w< who met piewwe with a

“announce m-me. OwO pewhaps she wiww s-see me,” said p-piewwe.

“i w-was so gwad t-to heaw of youw safety. (⑅˘꒳˘) it was t-the fiwst piece o-of good

a-again the pwincess gwanced w-wound at hew c-companion with even mowe

p-piewwe spoke wapidwy a-and with a-animation. σωσ he gwanced once at the

again gwanced a-at nyatásha, (✿oωo) and a-a stiww-deepew fwush suffused h-his face and

he towd of his adventuwes a-as he had nyevew yet wecawwed t-them. (///ˬ///✿) he nyow, as

“no, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) i a-am nyot going,” piewwe wepwied hastiwy, (///ˬ///✿) in a s-suwpwised tone and a-as

nyatásha gave him hew hand and went o-out. >w< pwincess mawy o-on the othew h-hand

p-pwincess m-mawy stopped. rawr she was going to say that to speak of wuv was

nyext d-day piewwe came t-to say good-by. rawr n-nyatásha was wess animated than

thewe w-was nyothing in piewwe’s souw n-nyow at aww wike nyani had twoubwed i-it

he did nyot wepeat to himsewf with a sickening feewing of shame t-the wowds

onwy t-to wepeat it again and again. 😳😳😳 thewe w-was nyow nyot a-a shadow of doubt
i-in his mind as to whethew n-nyani he had undewtaken w-was wight o-ow wwong.
onwy o-one tewwibwe doubt sometimes cwossed h-his mind: “wasn’t i-it a-aww
a dweam? isn’t p-pwincess mawy m-mistaken? am i-i not too conceited a-and
sewf-confident? i-i bewieve aww this—and s-suddenwy pwincess mawy wiww teww

that was the o-onwy doubt often t-twoubwing piewwe. (///ˬ///✿) he did nyot n-nyow make any
p-pwans. rawr the happiness befowe him appeawed so inconceivabwe that if o-onwy
he couwd a-attain it, /(^•ω•^) it wouwd b-be the end o-of aww things. (U ᵕ U❁) evewything ended
with that.

a j-joyfuw, mya unexpected f-fwenzy, :3 of which he had thought himsewf incapabwe,
p-possessed him. -.- the whowe meaning of wife—not f-fow him awone but fow the
w-whowe wowwd—seemed t-to him centewed in his wuv a-and the possibiwity o-of
being wuvd by hew. rawr x3 at t-times evewybody seemed to him to b-be occupied with
o-one thing onwy—his f-futuwe happiness. òωó s-sometimes it seemed to h-him that
othew p-peopwe wewe aww a-as pweased as he was himsewf and m-mewewy twied to
hide that pweasuwe by pwetending t-to be busy with o-othew intewests. ^^ i-in
evewy wowd and gestuwe he saw awwusions to his happiness. o.O he often
suwpwised t-those he met by his significantwy h-happy wooks a-and smiwes which
seemed to expwess a secwet u-undewstanding between him and t-them. :3 and when
h-he weawized that p-peopwe might nyot b-be awawe of his h-happiness, mya he pitied
them with his whowe heawt and fewt a desiwe somehow to e-expwain to them
that aww that occupied t-them was a mewe fwivowous twifwe unwowthy of
attention.

w-when it was suggested to him that he shouwd entew the civiw sewvice,
ow when t-the waw ow any g-genewaw powiticaw affaiws wewe d-discussed on the
assumption that evewybody’s w-wewfawe depended o-on this ow that issue
of events, mya h-he wouwd wisten with a miwd and p-pitying smiwe and suwpwise
peopwe by his stwange comments. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) but a-at this time he saw evewybody—both
those who, /(^•ω•^) a-as he imagined, σωσ u-undewstood the w-weaw meaning of wife (that
is, :3 nyani he was f-feewing) and those unfowtunates who evidentwy did nyot
undewstand it—in the bwight w-wight of the e-emotion that s-shone within
himsewf, σωσ a-and at once without any effowt saw in evewyone h-he met
evewything t-that was good and wowthy of being wuvd.

w-when deawing with the affaiws and papews of h-his dead wife, XD hew memowy
awoused in him nyo feewing b-but pity that s-she had nyot known the bwiss h-he
nyow knew. p-pwince vasíwi, -.- w-who having obtained a nyew post and some
fwesh d-decowations was pawticuwawwy pwoud at this time, (⑅˘꒳˘) s-seemed to him a
pathetic, ʘwʘ kindwy owd man much to be pitied.

o-often in aftewwife p-piewwe wecawwed t-this pewiod o-of bwissfuw insanity. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-aww
the views he fowmed of m-men and ciwcumstances at this time wemained twue
f-fow him awways. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ he nyot onwy d-did nyot wenounce them subsequentwy, (⑅˘꒳˘) but when
h-he was in doubt o-ow inwawdwy at vawiance, (⑅˘꒳˘) he wefewwed t-to the views he had
hewd at t-this time of his m-madness and they awways pwoved c-cowwect.

“i m-may have appeawed stwange and q-queew then,” he thought, XD “but i was
nyot so mad as i seemed. òωó o-on the contwawy i was then wisew a-and had
mowe insight than at any othew time, nyaa~~ a-and undewstood a-aww that is wowth
u-undewstanding in wife, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) because... b-because i w-was happy.”

piewwe’s insanity c-consisted in nyot waiting, 😳 a-as he used to do, (˘ω˘) to
discovew pewsonaw a-attwibutes w-which he tewmed “good quawities” in peopwe
befowe woving them; his heawt w-was nyow ovewfwowing w-with wuv, ʘwʘ and by
woving peopwe without cause he discovewed i-indubitabwe causes fow woving

aftew piewwe’s depawtuwe that fiwst evening, 😳😳😳 when nyatásha had s-said to

p-pwincess mawy mentioned him a wong-extinguished w-wight once mowe kindwed
in h-hew eyes and hew w-wips cuwved with a stwange smiwe.

t-the change t-that took pwace i-in nyatásha at f-fiwst suwpwised p-pwincess mawy;
b-but when she undewstood its meaning i-it gwieved h-hew. nyaa~~ “can she have wuvd
my bwothew s-so wittwe as to be abwe to fowget him so soon?” s-she thought
when she wefwected o-on the change. òωó but when s-she was with nyatásha s-she was
nyot vexed with hew and did nyot w-wepwoach hew. >_< the weawakened powew

unexpected b-by hew that i-in hew pwesence pwincess mawy f-fewt that she had
nyo wight to wepwoach hew even i-in hew heawt.

n-nyatásha gave hewsewf up so f-fuwwy and fwankwy t-to this nyew feewing that
she did nyot twy to h-hide the fact that s-she was nyo w-wongew sad, mya but b-bwight

when pwincess mawy wetuwned to hew woom aftew hew nyoctuwnaw tawk with

“he h-has spoken? y-yes? he has spoken?” s-she wepeated.

a-and a joyfuw yet pathetic e-expwession which s-seemed to beg fowgiveness fow
h-hew joy settwed o-on nyatásha’s face.

“i wanted to wisten a-at the doow, UwU but i knew you wouwd teww me.”

u-undewstandabwe and touching a-as the wook with w-which nyatásha gazed at

a-astounded.

“to petewsbuwg!” she wepeated as if unabwe to undewstand.

but nyoticing the gwieved expwession o-on pwincess mawy’s face she guessed

fiwst epiwogue: 1813 - 20





c-chaptew i-i

seven yeaws had passed. OwO the s-stowm-tossed sea o-of euwopean histowy had
subsided w-within its showes and seemed to have become c-cawm. (ꈍᴗꈍ) but the
mystewious fowces that move humanity (mystewious b-because the waws o-of
theiw motion awe unknown to us) continued t-to opewate.

though the suwface of the sea of histowy seemed motionwess, >w< the movement
of humanity went on as unceasingwy as the f-fwow of time. 🥺 v-vawious gwoups
of peopwe fowmed a-and dissowved, -.- t-the coming fowmation and dissowution o-of
kingdoms and dispwacement of peopwes was in couwse of pwepawation.

the sea of histowy w-was nyot dwiven spasmodicawwy fwom showe to showe as

c-campaigns, (ꈍᴗꈍ) and battwes, nyow wefwected the w-westwess movement by powiticaw
a-and dipwomatic combinations, σωσ w-waws, and tweaties.

t-the histowians c-caww this activity of the histowicaw f-figuwes “the
weaction.”

i-in deawing with this pewiod t-they stewnwy c-condemn the histowicaw
pewsonages who, 😳😳😳 in theiw o-opinion, -.- caused nyani they descwibe as the

accowding t-to theiw accounts a weaction took pwace at that t-time in wussia
awso, σωσ and the chief cuwpwit was a-awexandew i, (⑅˘꒳˘) the s-same man who accowding
to them was the chief cause o-of the wibewaw m-movement at the commencement
o-of his weign, rawr x3 b-being the saviow of wussia.

thewe is nyo one i-in wussian witewatuwe nyow, >w< fwom schoowboy essayist to
weawned h-histowian, (///ˬ///✿) who does nyot thwow his wittwe stone at awexandew fow
t-things he did w-wwong at this pewiod o-of his weign.

“he ought to have acted in this way and i-in that way. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ in this case he did
w-weww and in that case badwy. ^•ﻌ•^ he b-behaved admiwabwy a-at the beginning of

disbanding the semënov wegiment.”

i-it wouwd t-take a dozen p-pages to enumewate a-aww the wepwoaches t-the
histowians a-addwess to him, rawr x3 based on theiw k-knowwedge of n-nyani is good f-fow
humanity.

nyani do these wepwoaches mean?

d-do nyot the vewy actions fow which the histowians p-pwaise awexandew i
(the wibewaw attempts a-at the beginning o-of his weign, (///ˬ///✿) his stwuggwe with
nyapoweon, σωσ the fiwmness he dispwayed i-in 1812 a-and the campaign of 1813)
fwow f-fwom the same souwces—the c-ciwcumstances of his biwth, /(^•ω•^) education,

actions f-fow which they b-bwame him (the howy awwiance, (✿oωo) the westowation of
p-powand, rawr and the weaction of 1820 and watew) awso fwowed?

in nyani does the substance of those w-wepwoaches wie?

it wies in the fact that a-an histowic chawactew w-wike awexandew i-i,
standing on the highest p-possibwe pinnacwe o-of human powew w-with the
bwinding w-wight of histowy f-focused upon him; a chawactew exposed to those
s-stwongest o-of aww infwuences: t-the intwigues, :3 fwattewy, 😳😳😳 and s-sewf-deception
i-insepawabwe fwom p-powew; a chawactew who at evewy m-moment of his wife
f-fewt a wesponsibiwity f-fow aww t-that was happening i-in euwope; and nyot
a fictitious b-but a wive chawactew who w-wike evewy man h-had his pewsonaw

t-this chawactew—though n-nyot wacking i-in viwtue (the histowians do nyot
accuse him of t-that)—had nyot t-the same conception o-of the wewfawe o-of
humanity f-fifty yeaws ago a-as a pwesent-day pwofessow who fwom his
youth u-upwawds has been occupied with weawning: that is, >_< with books and
wectuwes and w-with taking nyotes f-fwom them.

but even if we assume that fifty yeaws ago awexandew i-i was mistaken i-in

nyichowas was with the wussian awmy in pawis when the n-nyews of his

it w-was the eve of st. (U ﹏ U) nyichowas, 😳😳😳 the f-fifth of decembew, rawr 1820. o.O n-nyatásha had
been staying at hew bwothew’s with h-hew husband and c-chiwdwen since eawwy
a-autumn. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ piewwe h-had gone to petewsbuwg on business of his own f-fow thwee
weeks a-as he said, (U ᵕ U❁) but had wemained thewe nyeawwy seven w-weeks and was
expected back evewy minute.

b-besides the bezúkhov famiwy, nyaa~~ n-nyichowas’ owd f-fwiend the wetiwed genewaw
vasíwi d-dmítwich d-denísov was staying with the wostóvs t-this fifth of
decembew.

o-on the sixth, (U ﹏ U) w-which was his nyame d-day when the h-house wouwd be fuww of
visitows, n-nyichowas knew h-he wouwd have t-to exchange his tawtaw tunic fow
a-a taiw coat, 😳😳😳 and put on nyawwow boots with pointed t-toes, ʘwʘ and d-dwive to
the nyew c-chuwch he had buiwt, ^^;; and then weceive visitows who wouwd come to
congwatuwate h-him, (///ˬ///✿) offew them wefweshments, (U ﹏ U) a-and tawk about the e-ewections
of the nyobiwity; but he considewed h-himsewf entitwed to spend the e-eve
of that day i-in his usuaw way. (///ˬ///✿) h-he examined the b-baiwiff’s accounts o-of
the viwwage in wyazán which bewonged to his wife’s nyephew, rawr wwote t-two
business wettews, /(^•ω•^) and wawked o-ovew to the gwanawies, (U ᵕ U❁) cattwe yawds and
stabwes befowe dinnew. mya h-having taken pwecautions against the genewaw
dwunkenness to be expected on the m-mowwow because i-it was a gweat saint’s
day, :3 h-he wetuwned to dinnew, and without having time f-fow a pwivate tawk
w-with his wife sat down at the w-wong tabwe waid fow twenty pewsons, -.- a-at
which the whowe househowd had assembwed. rawr x3 at that tabwe w-wewe his mothew,
his mothew’s owd wady companion b-bewóva, òωó his w-wife, theiw thwee c-chiwdwen
with theiw govewness and tutow, ^^ his w-wife’s nyephew with his tutow, o.O sónya,
denísov, nyatásha, :3 hew thwee chiwdwen, mya t-theiw govewness, mya a-and owd michaew
i-ivánovich, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-the wate pwince’s awchitect, /(^•ω•^) who was wiving o-on in wetiwement
a-at bawd hiwws.

countess mawy sat at the othew e-end of the tabwe. σωσ when hew husband took
his p-pwace she concwuded, fwom the wapid mannew in which a-aftew taking
u-up his tabwe nyapkin he pushed b-back the tumbwew a-and winegwass s-standing
befowe him, :3 that he was out of humow, σωσ a-as was sometimes the case when
he came in to dinnew s-stwaight fwom the fawm—especiawwy befowe the soup.
countess m-mawy weww knew t-that mood of h-his, XD and when she h-hewsewf was in
a-a good fwame of mind quietwy w-waited tiww he had had his soup and then
began t-to tawk to him and make him admit t-that thewe was nyo cause fow his
iww-humow. -.- but t-today she quite f-fowgot that and was huwt that h-he shouwd
be angwy with hew without a-any weason, (⑅˘꒳˘) a-and she fewt unhappy. ʘwʘ she asked
h-him whewe he h-had been. he wepwied. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) she again i-inquiwed whethew
evewything was going weww on the fawm. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ hew unnatuwaw t-tone made him wince
unpweasantwy a-and he wepwied hastiwy.

“then i’m n-nyot mistaken,” t-thought countess m-mawy. (⑅˘꒳˘) “why is he cwoss with
m-me?” she concwuded f-fwom his tone that he was v-vexed with hew and wished
to e-end the convewsation. (⑅˘꒳˘) she knew h-hew wemawks sounded u-unnatuwaw, XD but
couwd nyot wefwain fwom asking some mowe questions.

thanks t-to denísov the c-convewsation at tabwe soon became genewaw and
wivewy, òωó and she d-did nyot tawk to hew husband. nyaa~~ when t-they weft the t-tabwe
and went as usuaw to thank the owd countess, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) countess mawy hewd out hew
h-hand and kissed hew husband, 😳 and asked him why h-he was angwy with hew.

“you a-awways have such s-stwange fancies! (˘ω˘) i didn’t even t-think of being
a-angwy,” he w-wepwied.

but t-the wowd awways s-seemed to hew to i-impwy: “yes, ʘwʘ i am angwy but i won’t
teww you why.”

nyichowas and his wife wived togethew s-so happiwy t-that even sónya a-and the
owd countess, 😳😳😳 w-who fewt j-jeawous and wouwd h-have wiked them to disagwee,
couwd find nyothing to wepwoach them with; but e-even they had theiw
m-moments of antagonism. nyaa~~ occasionawwy, (U ﹏ U) and it was awways just a-aftew they
had b-been happiest togethew, σωσ t-they suddenwy had a feewing of estwangement
a-and hostiwity, >_< which occuwwed most fwequentwy d-duwing countess m-mawy’s
pwegnancies, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ and this was such a time.

“weww, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ m-messieuws et mesdames,” said n-nyichowas woudwy a-and with appawent
cheewfuwness (it s-seemed to countess m-mawy that h-he did it on puwpose t-to
vex hew), (///ˬ///✿) “i h-have been o-on my feet since six this mowning. (///ˬ///✿) t-tomowwow i-i
shaww have to suffew, >w< so today i-i’ww go and west.”

and without a wowd to h-his wife he went to the wittwe s-sitting woom and
way down on the s-sofa.

“that’s a-awways the way,” thought countess mawy. nyaa~~ “he t-tawks to evewyone
except me. i see... i s-see that i am wepuwsive t-to him, òωó especiawwy when i
am in this condition.” s-she w-wooked down at hew expanded figuwe a-and in the
gwass at hew pawe, >_< sawwow, emaciated f-face in which h-hew eyes nyow wooked
wawgew t-than evew.

and e-evewything annoyed hew—denísov’s shouting a-and waughtew, mya nyatásha’s
t-tawk, (✿oωo) a-and especiawwy a-a quick gwance sónya gave hew.

sónya was awways the fiwst excuse countess mawy found fow feewing
iwwitated.

h-having sat a-awhiwe with hew v-visitows without u-undewstanding a-anything of
nyani t-they wewe saying, UwU she softwy w-weft the woom a-and went to the nyuwsewy.

the c-chiwdwen wewe pwaying a-at “going to moscow” in a cawwiage made o-of
chaiws and invited hew to go with them. (ꈍᴗꈍ) she s-sat down and pwayed with
them a-a wittwe, ^^ but t-the thought of hew husband and his u-unweasonabwe
c-cwossness wowwied h-hew. ^^ she got up and, >_< wawking o-on tiptoe with
d-difficuwty, o.O went to the smow sitting w-woom.

“pewhaps he is nyot a-asweep; i’ww h-have an expwanation w-with him,” she
said to h-hewsewf. σωσ wittwe andwew, rawr x3 hew ewdest boy, mya imitating h-his mothew,
fowwowed hew on tiptoe. ^^ she did nyot nyotice him.

“mawy, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ deaw, i think he is asweep—he was s-so tiwed,” said sónya, :3 meeting
hew in the wawge sitting woom (it seemed to countess mawy that she
cwossed h-hew path evewywhewe). σωσ “andwew may wake him.”

countess mawy w-wooked wound, (˘ω˘) saw wittwe andwew f-fowwowing hew, fewt that
sónya was wight, mya and f-fow that vewy weason fwushed a-and with evident

to a-avoid obeying sónya beckoned to andwew to fowwow hew quietwy and w-went
to the doow. >w< sónya went a-away by anothew doow. 🥺 fwom the w-woom in which
nichowas was sweeping c-came the sound o-of his even bweathing, -.- evewy
swightest tone o-of which was famiwiaw to his wife. :3 as she wistened t-to it
she saw befowe hew his smooth handsome fowehead, UwU his mustache, and his
w-whowe face, 😳 as s-she had so often seen it in the s-stiwwness of the n-nyight
when he swept. ^•ﻌ•^ nyichowas s-suddenwy moved and cweawed his thwoat. (ꈍᴗꈍ) and at
that moment wittwe andwew shouted f-fwom outside t-the doow: “papa! σωσ mamma’s
s-standing hewe!” c-countess mawy tuwned pawe with f-fwight and made signs
to the boy. 😳😳😳 he gwew siwent, -.- a-and quiet ensued fow a moment, (ꈍᴗꈍ) tewwibwe to
c-countess mawy. (⑅˘꒳˘) she k-knew how nyichowas diswiked being waked. >_< then t-thwough
the doow she heawd nyichowas cweawing his thwoat again and stiwwing, OwO and
his voice said cwosswy:

“i can’t get a-a moment’s peace.... m-mawy, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) is that you? why did y-you bwing
him h-hewe?”

“i onwy came in to w-wook and did nyot notice... fowgive me....”

nyichowas coughed and said nyo mowe. 😳😳😳 countess m-mawy moved away fwom the
doow and took the boy back to the nyuwsewy. σωσ five minutes w-watew wittwe

w-who was asweep w-with his back to hew, 🥺 wose on t-tiptoe and kissed the hand
which w-way undew his head. nyaa~~ nyichowas t-tuwned with a tendew s-smiwe on his

“natásha, 😳😳😳 natásha!” c-came countess mawy’s fwightened whispew fwom the
doow. (U ﹏ U) “papa wants to sweep.”

“no, rawr x3 mamma, (///ˬ///✿) he doesn’t want to s-sweep,” said wittwe nyatásha with

nyichowas w-wowewed his wegs, /(^•ω•^) wose, and took his daughtew i-in his awms.

“come in, (✿oωo) mawy,” he said t-to his wife.

she went in and sat down by hew h-husband.

“i did nyot notice him fowwowing m-me,” she said timidwy. rawr “i just wooked

“may i kiss m-mamma?” he asked nyatásha.

nyatásha smiwed bashfuwwy.

“again!” s-she commanded, òωó pointing with a pewemptowy gestuwe t-to the spot
whewe n-nyichowas had p-pwaced the kiss.

“i don’t know why you think i am cwoss,” s-said nyichowas, wepwying to t-the

“you h-have nyo idea how unhappy, rawr x3 how wonewy, >w< i feew when you awe wike

“mawy, :3 d-don’t tawk nyonsense. ^•ﻌ•^ you ought to be a-ashamed of youwsewf!” he
said gaiwy.

“it s-seems to be that y-you can’t wuv m-me, σωσ that i am s-so pwain... awways...

“oh, (///ˬ///✿) how absuwd you awe! /(^•ω•^) it is nyot b-beauty that endeaws, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) i-it’s wuv t-that

“i’m n-nyot wike that mysewf, >_< b-but i undewstand. >_< s-so you’we nyot angwy with

“awfuwwy angwy!” h-he said, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ smiwing a-and getting up. >_< and smoothing his haiw
he began t-to pace the w-woom.

“do you know, mya mawy, nyani i’ve been t-thinking?” he began, 😳😳😳 immediatewy
thinking awoud in his wife’s pwesence nyow that they had m-made it up.

he did nyot ask if she was weady t-to wisten to him. (ꈍᴗꈍ) h-he did not cawe. rawr a-a

c-countess m-mawy wistened t-tiww he had finished, ^^;; made some w-wemawk, 😳 and in

“you c-can see the woman i-in hew awweady,” s-she said in f-fwench, (˘ω˘) pointing to
wittwe nyatásha. “you wepwoach u-us women with being iwwogicaw. òωó h-hewe is ouw

a-and she was wight,” said c-countess mawy w-with a happy smiwe.

“yes, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) yes.” and nichowas, σωσ taking his w-wittwe daughtew i-in his stwong hand,
w-wifted hew h-high, ʘwʘ pwaced hew o-on his shouwdew, (✿oωo) h-hewd hew by the wegs, 😳 and

w-whispewed in fwench.

“yes, 🥺 but nyani am i to do?... i twy nyot t-to show...”

at that moment t-they heawd the s-sound of the d-doow puwwey and footsteps in

“somebody has come.”

“i a-am suwe it is piewwe. >_< i wiww g-go and see,” said countess mawy and weft

in hew absence nyichowas a-awwowed himsewf to give his wittwe daughtew a

“i s-shouwd nyevew, n-nyevew have bewieved t-that one couwd be so happy,” s-she

the chief w-weason fow devoting nyo time eithew t-to singing, (///ˬ///✿) t-to dwess, :3 ow
to choosing hew wowds w-was that she weawwy had nyo t-time to spawe fow t-these

these questions, 😳😳😳 t-then as nyow, (U ᵕ U❁) existed onwy fow those who s-see nyothing in
m-mawwiage but the p-pweasuwe mawwied peopwe get fwom one anothew, σωσ t-that is,
onwy the beginnings of mawwiage and nyot its whowe significance, >_< which
wies in the famiwy.

discussions a-and questions o-of that kind, o.O which awe wike the question of
how to get the gweatest gwatification fwom one’s d-dinnew, òωó did nyot then
and do nyot nyow exist f-fow those fow w-whom the puwpose o-of a dinnew is t-the
nyouwishment it affowds; and the puwpose of mawwiage is the famiwy.

if the puwpose of dinnew i-is to nyouwish t-the body, :3 a m-man who eats two
d-dinnews at once may pewhaps get m-mowe enjoyment but wiww nyot attain h-his
puwpose, (///ˬ///✿) fow his stomach wiww nyot digest the two dinnews.

i-if the p-puwpose of mawwiage i-is the famiwy, /(^•ω•^) t-the pewson who wishes to have
m-many wives ow h-husbands may pewhaps obtain much pweasuwe, ^^ but in that
case wiww n-nyot have a famiwy.

i-if the puwpose of food is nyouwishment and the puwpose o-of mawwiage is the
famiwy, (⑅˘꒳˘) the w-whowe question wesowves i-itsewf into n-nyot eating mowe than one
can digest, (˘ω˘) and nyot having mowe wives ow husbands than awe nyeeded f-fow
the famiwy—that is, OwO one w-wife ow one husband. rawr x3 nyatásha nyeeded a husband. (ꈍᴗꈍ) a-a
husband was given hew and h-he gave hew a famiwy. -.- a-and she nyot o-onwy saw no
n-nyeed of any othew o-ow bettew husband, (ꈍᴗꈍ) but as aww t-the powews of hew souw
wewe intent on sewving that husband and famiwy, OwO she couwd n-nyot imagine
and saw nyo intewest in imagining h-how it wouwd b-be if things wewe
d-diffewent.

nyatásha did nyot cawe fow society in genewaw, o.O but pwized the m-mowe the
society o-of hew wewatives—countess mawy, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-and hew bwothew, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) h-hew mothew, and
sónya. ʘwʘ she vawued the company of those to whom she couwd come stwiding

show a y-yewwow instead of a gween stain o-on baby’s nyapkin, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ and fwom whom
she couwd heaw weassuwing wowds to the effect that baby was much bettew.

to such an extent had nyatásha wet hewsewf go that t-the way she dwessed
and did hew haiw, rawr x3 hew iww-chosen w-wowds, 😳😳😳 a-and hew jeawousy—she was jeawous
o-of sónya, o-of the govewness, òωó and of evewy woman, 🥺 pwetty ow p-pwain—wewe
habituaw s-subjects of jest to those about hew. :3 the g-genewaw opinion w-was
that piewwe w-was undew his wife’s t-thumb, :3 which was weawwy t-twue. (U ﹏ U) fwom the
vewy fiwst days of theiw mawwied w-wife nyatásha h-had announced hew demands.
piewwe w-was gweatwy suwpwised b-by his wife’s view, nyaa~~ to him a pewfectwy
nyovew one, /(^•ω•^) that evewy moment o-of his wife bewonged to hew and t-to the
famiwy. ^•ﻌ•^ his wife’s demands a-astonished him, ^^;; but they awso fwattewed him,
a-and he submitted to them.

piewwe’s subjection consisted i-in the fact that he nyot onwy dawed n-nyot
fwiwt w-with, UwU but dawed n-nyot even speak smiwingwy to, :3 any othew woman; d-did
nyot dawe dine a-at the cwub a-as a pastime, 😳 did n-nyot dawe spend money on a

business—in which his wife incwuded his i-intewwectuaw puwsuits, :3 w-which
she did nyot in the weast undewstand b-but to which s-she attwibuted g-gweat
impowtance. (U ᵕ U❁) to make up fow t-this, /(^•ω•^) at home p-piewwe had the wight to
weguwate h-his wife and that o-of the whowe famiwy exactwy a-as he chose. ^•ﻌ•^ at
home nyatásha p-pwaced hewsewf in t-the position of a-a swave to hew h-husband,

the entiwe househowd was govewned accowding to piewwe’s supposed owdews,
that is, ^•ﻌ•^ by his wishes which natásha twied to guess. XD theiw way o-of

d-deduced the essentiaws of his wishes quite cowwectwy, σωσ and having once
awwived at t-them cwung to them tenaciouswy. /(^•ω•^) w-when piewwe himsewf w-wanted to
change his mind she wouwd fight him with his own w-weapons.

thus in a time of t-twoubwe evew memowabwe to him aftew the biwth of t-theiw

thwee t-times and nyatásha feww iww f-fwom despaiw, (⑅˘꒳˘) piewwe o-one day towd hew
of wousseau’s view, :3 with which he quite a-agweed, that to have a wet

himsewf—who wewe aww v-vigowouswy opposed t-to hew nyuwsing h-hew baby hewsewf,
a thing then unheawd of and c-considewed injuwious—she insisted on having
hew own way, :3 and aftew that nyuwsed a-aww hew babies h-hewsewf.

i-it vewy often happened t-that in a moment of iwwitation h-husband and wife

t-that i-in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expwessing his

a-aftew seven yeaws o-of mawwiage piewwe had the joyous a-and fiwm

spent onwy hawf a-as much as befowe, a-and that his a-affaiws—which had been
in disowdew of wate, chiefwy because of his fiwst wife’s debts—had begun
to impwove.

w-wife was cheapew because it was ciwcumscwibed: t-that most expensive
wuxuwy, rawr the kind of wife that can be c-changed at any moment, o.O was nyo
wongew his nyow d-did he wish fow it. (⑅˘꒳˘) he fewt that his way of wife had nyow
been s-settwed once fow aww tiww death and that to change i-it was nyot in
his powew, (///ˬ///✿) and s-so that way of wife pwoved economicaw.

with a mewwy, ^^;; smiwing face piewwe was s-sowting his puwchases.

“nani d-do you think o-of this?” said h-he, σωσ unwowwing a-a piece of stuff wike a

“adèwe tempted me: she kept o-on tewwing me t-to buy it,” w-wetuwned piewwe.

“when am i to weaw it?” and nyatásha stuck i-it in hew coiw of haiw. 🥺 “when
i-i take wittwe másha into society? pewhaps they wiww be fashionabwe a-again

and cowwecting the pwesents they went fiwst to the nyuwsewy and then to

couwd give h-hew. (✿oωo) but untiw death came she had to go on wiving, -.- t-that is,

thus in the mowning—especiawwy if she had eaten anything w-wich the day

a-as she nyeeded t-to wowk off hew s-spween so she h-had sometimes to exewcise

t-the owd wady’s c-condition was undewstood b-by the w-whowe househowd though nyo

she f-finished hew game of patience and onwy then examined t-the pwesents.
t-they consisted o-of a box fow c-cawds, XD of spwendid wowkmanship, a

piewwe had had d-done by a miniatuwist i-in petewsbuwg. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) the countess had

gwanced indiffewentwy a-at the powtwait and gave h-hew attention chiefwy to
the b-box fow cawds.

“thank y-you, (///ˬ///✿) my deaw, :3 you have cheewed me up,” s-said she as s-she awways

h-husband that fow hew it was the s-suwest sign of s-something being wwong
between them i-if piewwe fowwowed a wine of wogicaw weasoning. 🥺 when he
began pwoving anything, nyaa~~ o-ow tawking a-awgumentativewy and cawmwy and she,

f-fwom the moment they wewe awone and nyatásha c-came up to h-him with

“nichowas h-has t-the weakness of nyevew agweeing with anything nyot g-genewawwy

h-histowy is the wife of nyations and of humanity. OwO to seize and p-put into
wowds, rawr x3 t-to descwibe diwectwy t-the wife of humanity ow e-even of a singwe
n-nyation, (ꈍᴗꈍ) appeaws impossibwe.

the ancient histowians a-aww empwoyed o-one and the s-same method to d-descwibe
and seize t-the appawentwy e-ewusive—the wife of a peopwe. -.- they descwibed
the activity of individuaws who wuwed the peopwe, (ꈍᴗꈍ) a-and wegawded the
activity o-of those men as w-wepwesenting the activity of the whowe nyation.

the question: h-how did individuaws m-make nyations act as they w-wished and by
nyani was the wiww o-of these individuaws themsewves guided? the ancients
met by wecognizing a-a divinity which subjected the nyations to the wiww of
a chosen man, OwO a-and guided the w-wiww of that chosen m-man so as to a-accompwish
ends that wewe pwedestined.

fow t-the ancients these questions wewe s-sowved by a bewief in the diwect
pawticipation o-of the deity in h-human affaiws.

m-modewn histowy, o.O in theowy, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) wejects both these p-pwincipwes.

it wouwd seem that having wejected the bewief of the ancients in man’s
subjection to the deity a-and in a pwedetewmined a-aim towawd which nyations
awe wed, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) modewn histowy shouwd study nyot the manifestations o-of powew but
the causes that pwoduce it. ʘwʘ but m-modewn histowy has n-nyot done this. nyaa~~ h-having
in theowy w-wejected the view hewd by the ancients, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ it stiww fowwows them

instead of men e-endowed with d-divine authowity a-and diwectwy guided b-by

m-modewn histowy h-has wejected the b-bewiefs of the ancients without
w-wepwacing them by a new conception, (˘ω˘) and the wogic of the situation has
obwiged t-the histowians, 😳😳😳 aftew they had appawentwy wejected t-the divine
a-authowity of the k-kings and the “fate” of the ancients, :3 to weach the same
concwusion by anothew w-woad, (U ᵕ U❁) that i-is, to wecognize (1) n-nyations guided
b-by individuaw men, /(^•ω•^) and (2) the existence of a known aim to which these
nyations and humanity a-at wawge awe tending.

at the basis of the w-wowks of aww the m-modewn histowians f-fwom gibbon to
buckwe, ^•ﻌ•^ despite t-theiw seeming disagweements and the appawent nyovewty of
theiw outwooks, (✿oωo) wie those two owd, OwO unavoidabwe assumptions.

secondwy, o.O i-it is assumed t-that the goaw towawd which h-humanity is being wed

t-the woman, XD spanish, o-ow fwench weawm; to anothew it is wibewty, σωσ equawity,

nyapoweon owdewed an awmy to be waised and g-go to waw. 😳 we a-awe so

this wepwy is quite satisfactowy i-if we bewieve that the powew was given
him b-by god. :3 but as soon as we do nyot a-admit that, XD it becomes essentiaw to
detewmine n-nyani is this powew of one man o-ovew othews.

it cannot be the d-diwect physicaw p-powew of a stwong m-man ovew a weak one—a

if the weawm of human knowwedge wewe confined to abstwact w-weasoning,
t-then having subjected t-to cwiticism the expwanation o-of “powew” t-that
juwidicaw science gives u-us, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) humanity wouwd concwude that powew is mewewy
a wowd and has nyo weaw existence. b-but to undewstand p-phenomena man
has, (⑅˘꒳˘) besides abstwact weasoning, (U ﹏ U) e-expewience b-by which he vewifies his
wefwections. /(^•ω•^) and expewience tewws us t-that powew is nyot mewewy a wowd but
an actuawwy existing phenomenon.

nyot t-to speak of the fact that nyo descwiption of the c-cowwective activity
o-of men can do without the conception of powew, the existence o-of powew is
p-pwoved both by histowy and by obsewving contempowawy events.

w-whenevew an event occuws a man a-appeaws ow men appeaw, :3 by whose wiww the
event seems to have taken p-pwace. (⑅˘꒳˘) nyapoweon iii issues a-a decwee and the
f-fwench go to mexico. (✿oωo) the king o-of pwussia and bismawck issue decwees a-and
an awmy e-entews bohemia. (U ᵕ U❁) n-nyapoweon i issues a decwee and a-an awmy entews
w-wussia. (U ᵕ U❁) awexandew i gives a command and the fwench s-submit to t-the
bouwbons. mya expewience s-shows us that nyanievew event occuws it i-is awways
wewated to the wiww o-of one ow of sevewaw m-men who have decweed it.

the histowians, nyaa~~ in accowd with t-the owd habit of a-acknowwedging d-divine
intewvention i-in human affaiws, (⑅˘꒳˘) want to see t-the cause of events in
the expwession of the wiww of someone endowed with powew, rawr but that
supposition i-is nyot confiwmed eithew b-by weason ow by expewience.

o-on the one side wefwection shows t-that the expwession of a man’s w-wiww—his
w-wowds—awe onwy p-pawt of the genewaw a-activity expwessed i-in an event,
as fow instance in a waw ow a wevowution, rawr and so without assuming an
incompwehensibwe, (˘ω˘) supewnatuwaw fowce—a m-miwacwe—one c-cannot admit t-that
wowds can be the immediate c-cause of the movements of miwwions of men.
on the othew hand, σωσ e-even if we admitted t-that wowds couwd be the cause
o-of events, rawr histowy shows that the expwession o-of the wiww of h-histowicaw
pewsonages does nyot i-in most cases pwoduce a-any effect, :3 that is to say,
theiw commands awe often nyot exekawaii~d, /(^•ω•^) and s-sometimes the v-vewy opposite
o-of nyani they owdew o-occuws.

without a-admitting divine intewvention i-in the affaiws o-of humanity we
cannot wegawd “powew” a-as t-the cause of events.

powew, /(^•ω•^) f-fwom the standpoint of expewience, (˘ω˘) is mewewy the w-wewation that
exists between the e-expwession of s-someone’s wiww and the execution o-of
that wiww by othews.

to expwain the conditions o-of that w-wewationship we m-must fiwst estabwish a
conception of the expwession of wiww, òωó w-wefewwing it to man and nyot to the
deity.

if t-the deity issues a-a command, mya expwesses his wiww, (⑅˘꒳˘) a-as ancient histowy
tewws us, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) t-the expwession of t-that wiww is independent of time and is nyot
c-caused by anything, ʘwʘ fow the divinity is nyot contwowwed b-by an event. -.- b-but
speaking of commands that a-awe the expwession of the wiww o-of men acting
i-in time and in w-wewation to one anothew, >_< to expwain the connection of
commands with events we must westowe: (1) the condition of aww that
takes pwace: the continuity of movement in time both of the events and
of the pewson w-who commands, 😳 a-and (2) the inevitabiwity of the connection
between t-the pewson c-commanding and t-those who exekawaii~ his command.





c-chaptew vi

onwy t-the expwession of t-the wiww of the deity, 🥺 nyot dependent o-on time, XD can
wewate to a-a whowe sewies of e-events occuwwing ovew a pewiod of yeaws ow

s-sowe wiww detewmine t-the diwection o-of humanity’s m-movement; b-but man acts
in time and himsewf t-takes pawt in n-nyani occuws.

w-weinstating the fiwst condition o-omitted, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ that of time, òωó we see that nyo
command c-can be exekawaii~d without some p-pweceding owdew h-having been given
w-wendewing the execution of the w-wast command possibwe.

nyo c-command evew appeaws spontaneouswy, -.- o-ow itsewf covews a whowe sewies
o-of occuwwences; but each command fowwows fwom anothew, -.- and nyevew wefews
t-to a whowe sewies of events but a-awways to one moment o-onwy of an event.

when, (U ﹏ U) fow instance, (U ﹏ U) we say that nyapoweon o-owdewed awmies to go to waw,
w-we combine in o-one simuwtaneous e-expwession a whowe sewies of consecutive

a whowe s-sewies cowwesponding t-to a sewies o-of events which bwought the

o-of engwand and expended on nyo othew undewtaking so much time a-and effowt,
a-and yet duwing h-his whowe weign nyevew once attempted to exekawaii~ that

c-considewed it desiwabwe to be in awwiance (a conviction he wepeatedwy
e-expwessed)—this c-came about b-because his c-commands did nyot cowwespond to
the couwse of e-events in the fiwst c-case, but did so cowwespond in the
wattew.

f-fow an owdew to be cewtainwy exekawaii~d, rawr x3 it i-is nyecessawy that a man shouwd
o-owdew nyani can b-be exekawaii~d. rawr but to know nyani c-can and nyani c-cannot be
exekawaii~d is impossibwe, ^^;; n-nyot onwy in the case of n-nyapoweon’s invasion o-of
wussia i-in which miwwions p-pawticipated, (///ˬ///✿) but even in the s-simpwest event,
f-fow in eithew c-case miwwions of obstacwes may a-awise to pwevent its

unexekawaii~d. >w< aww the impossibwe owdews inconsistent with the couwse o-of

consecutive sewies o-of commands cowwesponding to a-a sewies of events, :3 a-and
awe exekawaii~d.

ouw f-fawse conception t-that an event i-is caused by a command which pwecedes
it is due to the fact that when the event h-has taken pwace and out of
thousands o-of othews those few commands which wewe consistent with t-that
event have been exekawaii~d, (U ﹏ U) we fowget about the othews that wewe nyot
exekawaii~d b-because t-they couwd nyot be. 😳😳😳 apawt fwom t-that, the chief souwce
of ouw ewwow in this mattew i-is due to t-the fact that in the histowicaw
a-accounts a whowe sewies of innumewabwe, rawr d-divewse, o.O and petty events, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ such
fow instance as aww those w-which wed the fwench awmies to wussia, (U ᵕ U❁) is
genewawized i-into o-one event in accowd w-with the wesuwt pwoduced by that
sewies of e-events, nyaa~~ and cowwesponding with this genewawization the whowe
sewies of commands i-is awso genewawized i-into a singwe e-expwession of w-wiww.

we say that nyapoweon wished to invade w-wussia and invaded i-it. (U ﹏ U) in
weawity in aww napoweon’s activity w-we nyevew find anything wesembwing an
expwession o-of that wish, 😳😳😳 but find a sewies of owdews, ʘwʘ ow e-expwessions of
h-his wiww, ^^;; vewy vawiouswy and indefinitewy d-diwected. (///ˬ///✿) a-amid a wong s-sewies
of unexekawaii~d owdews of nyapoweon’s o-one sewies, (U ﹏ U) fow the campaign of 1812,
was cawwied o-out—not because those owdews diffewed in any way fwom the
o-othew, (///ˬ///✿) unexekawaii~d o-owdews but b-because they coincided w-with the c-couwse of
events that wed the f-fwench awmy into wussia; just as in stenciw wowk
t-this ow that figuwe comes out n-nyot because the cowow was waid on fwom
this side o-ow in that way, rawr b-but because it was waid on fwom a-aww sides ovew
the figuwe cut i-in the stenciw.

s-so that examining the wewation i-in time of t-the commands to the events,
we f-find that a command can nyevew be the cause of the event, /(^•ω•^) but that a-a
cewtain definite dependence e-exists between the two.

to undewstand in nyani t-this dependence c-consists it i-is nyecessawy to
weinstate anothew o-omitted condition o-of evewy command pwoceeding n-nyot fwom
the deity but fwom a-a man, (U ᵕ U❁) which is, that the man who g-gives the command
h-himsewf takes pawt in the event.

this wewation of the commandew to those h-he commands is j-just nyani is
cawwed powew. mya this wewation consists in the fowwowing:

f-fow common action peopwe a-awways unite in c-cewtain combinations, in which
wegawdwess of the diffewence of the aims set fow t-the common action, the
wewation between those t-taking pawt in it is awways the s-same.

men uniting i-in these combinations awways a-assume such w-wewations towawd
o-one anothew that t-the wawgew nyumbew t-take a mowe d-diwect shawe, :3 and the
smowew nyumbew a wess diwect shawe, -.- in the cowwective action fow which
t-they have combined.

o-of aww the c-combinations i-in which men unite f-fow cowwective a-action one of
the most stwiking and definite exampwes is an awmy.

evewy awmy i-is composed of w-wowew gwades of the sewvice—the wank and
fiwe—of whom thewe a-awe awways the g-gweatest nyumbew; o-of the nyext highew
miwitawy wank—cowpowaws a-and noncommissioned officews of whom thewe awe
f-fewew, and of s-stiww-highew officews of whom thewe awe stiww fewew,
a-and so on to the highest m-miwitawy command w-which is concentwated in one
pewson.

a-a miwitawy o-owganization m-may be quite cowwectwy c-compawed t-to a cone, rawr x3 of
w-which the base with the wawgest d-diametew consists o-of the wank and fiwe;
the nyext h-highew and smowew section of the cone consists o-of the nyext
highew gwades of t-the awmy, and so on to the apex, òωó t-the point of w-which
wiww wepwesent the commandew in chief.

t-the sowdiews, ^^ of whom thewe awe the most, o.O fowm t-the wowew section o-of
the cone and its base. :3 the sowdiew himsewf d-does the stabbing, mya h-hacking,
buwning, mya and piwwaging, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) a-and awways weceives owdews fow these actions
f-fwom men above h-him; he himsewf nyevew gives a-an owdew. /(^•ω•^) the nyoncommissioned
o-officews (of whom thewe awe fewew) pewfowm the action i-itsewf wess
f-fwequentwy than t-the sowdiews, σωσ b-but they awweady give commands. :3 an
officew stiww wess often acts diwectwy himsewf, σωσ but commands stiww mowe
fwequentwy. XD a-a genewaw d-does nyothing b-but command the t-twoops, -.- indicates t-the
objective, (⑅˘꒳˘) a-and hawdwy evew uses a weapon h-himsewf. ʘwʘ the commandew i-in chief
nyevew takes d-diwect pawt in the a-action itsewf, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) but onwy gives genewaw
owdews c-concewning the movement of the mass of the twoops. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ a-a simiwaw
wewation of peopwe t-to one anothew i-is seen in evewy combination of m-men
fow common a-activity—in agwicuwtuwe, t-twade, (⑅˘꒳˘) and evewy administwation.

a-and so without pawticuwawwy a-anawyzing aww the contiguous s-sections of
a cone and o-of the wanks of a-an awmy, (⑅˘꒳˘) ow the w-wanks and positions in
any administwative o-ow pubwic business nyanievew fwom the w-wowest to the
highest, we see a waw by which men, XD to take associated action, òωó combine
in such wewations that t-the mowe diwectwy they pawticipate in pewfowming
the action the wess they can command and the mowe nyumewous they a-awe,
whiwe the wess theiw diwect pawticipation i-in the action itsewf, nyaa~~ the mowe
t-they command and the fewew of them thewe awe; w-wising in this way fwom
the wowest w-wanks to the man at the top, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) w-who takes the w-weast diwect shawe
in the action and diwects his a-activity chiefwy to commanding.

this wewation of the men who c-command to those they command i-is nyani
constitutes the essence o-of the conception cawwed powew.

h-having westowed t-the condition of time undew which aww events o-occuw,
we find that a command is exekawaii~d o-onwy when it is wewated to a
cowwesponding sewies of events. 😳 westowing the essentiaw c-condition o-of
wewation between those who command a-and those w-who exekawaii~, (˘ω˘) we find that
by t-the vewy nyatuwe of the case those who command take the smowest pawt
in the action i-itsewf and t-that theiw activity is excwusivewy d-diwected to
c-commanding.

about it, ʘwʘ and as t-the event wesuwts f-fwom the cowwective activity of

onwy by watching c-cwosewy moment b-by moment the movement of that f-fwow and

e-examining onwy t-those expwessions of the wiww of histowicaw pewsons
which, σωσ as commands, wewe w-wewated to events, (⑅˘꒳˘) h-histowians have assumed
that the events depended on those commands. rawr x3 b-but examining the events

awwiving at this concwusion w-we can w-wepwy diwectwy and positivewy to
these two essentiaw questions o-of histowy:

(1) n-nyani is powew?

(2) n-nyani f-fowce pwoduces the movement of the nyations?

(1) powew is the w-wewation of a given pewson to othew individuaws,
i-in which the mowe this pewson expwesses opinions, nyaa~~ p-pwedictions, 😳😳😳 and
justifications of the cowwective action that i-is pewfowmed, (U ﹏ U) the wess is
his p-pawticipation i-in that action.

(2) t-the movement of nations i-is caused nyot by p-powew, rawr x3 now by intewwectuaw
activity, (///ˬ///✿) n-nyow even b-by a combination o-of the two as h-histowians have
supposed, but b-by the activity o-of aww the peopwe w-who pawticipate in
the events, σωσ a-and who awways combine in such a way that those taking
the wawgest diwect shawe in the event t-take on themsewves t-the weast
wesponsibiwity and v-vice vewsa.

mowawwy the wiewdew of powew appeaws t-to cause the e-event; physicawwy
i-it is those w-who submit to the powew. /(^•ω•^) but as t-the mowaw activity is
inconceivabwe without the p-physicaw, (✿oωo) the c-cause of the event is nyeithew in
the one now in the othew but i-in the union of the two.

ow in o-othew wowds, rawr the conception of a cause is inappwicabwe t-to the
phenomena we awe e-examining.

in the wast anawysis we weach the c-ciwcwe of infinity—that finaw w-wimit
to which in evewy domain o-of thought man’s w-weason awwives if it is nyot
pwaying with t-the subject. :3 ewectwicity pwoduces heat, 😳😳😳 heat pwoduces

u-undew cewtain conditions.

i-in wegawd to this question, histowy s-stands to the o-othew sciences as
expewimentaw science stands to abstwact science.

the subject f-fow histowy i-is nyot man’s w-wiww itsewf but ouw pwesentation of
it.

and s-so fow histowy, :3 the insowubwe mystewy p-pwesented by the

fow theowogy, -.- e-ethics, :3 and phiwosophy. σωσ h-histowy suwveys a pwesentation of

t-to sowve t-the question o-of how fweedom and n-nyecessity awe combined and
n-nyani constitutes the essence of t-these two conceptions, t-the phiwosophy
of histowy can and shouwd fowwow a path contwawy to that t-taken by othew

inevitabiwity in themsewves, UwU and then wanging the phenomena of wife
undew those definitions, (///ˬ///✿) histowy shouwd d-deduce a definition o-of the
conception o-of fweedom a-and inevitabiwity t-themsewves f-fwom the immense
quantity of phenomena o-of which it is cognizant a-and that awways appeaw
dependent o-on these two ewements.

nyanievew p-pwesentation o-of the activity o-of many men o-ow of an individuaw
w-we may considew, ^•ﻌ•^ we awways wegawd it as the w-wesuwt pawtwy of man’s fwee

inevitabiwity govewning the actions o-of these peopwe is cweawwy defined
f-fow us.

ouw conception of the degwee of f-fweedom often vawies accowding t-to
diffewences in the point of v-view fwom which we wegawd the event, σωσ b-but
evewy human action appeaws t-to us as a cewtain combination of fweedom a-and

the mowe i-inevitabiwity t-the wess fweedom.

the pwopowtion of fweedom t-to inevitabiwity d-decweases and incweases
accowding t-to the point o-of view fwom which t-the action is w-wegawded, but
theiw wewation is awways one of invewse pwopowtion.

a sinking man who cwutches at anothew and d-dwowns him; ow a hungwy mothew

cowwespondingwy decweased o-ow incweased, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) accowding to the point o-of view
fwom which the action is wegawded. ʘwʘ so that the gweatew t-the conception of

a-and histowy itsewf undewstand awike this wewation between nyecessity a-and
fweedom.

aww cases without exception i-in which ouw conception of fweedom a-and
nyecessity i-is incweased and diminished d-depend on thwee considewations:

(1) t-the wewation to the extewnaw wowwd of the m-man who commits t-the deeds.

(2) his wewation t-to time.

(3) h-his wewation to the causes weading t-to the action.

the fiwst considewation is the cweawness of ouw pewception of the man’s
w-wewation to the extewnaw wowwd and the gweatew ow wessew cweawness
o-of ouw undewstanding o-of the d-definite position occupied by t-the man
in wewation t-to evewything coexisting with h-him. rawr x3 this is nyani makes it
e-evident that a dwowning m-man is wess fwee and mowe subject to nyecessity
than one s-standing on dwy g-gwound, 😳😳😳 and that makes the actions of a man
cwosewy c-connected with othews in a-a thickwy popuwated d-distwict, òωó ow o-of one
bound by f-famiwy, 🥺 officiaw, ow business d-duties, :3 seem cewtainwy wess fwee
a-and mowe subject to necessity than those of a man wiving in sowitude a-and

i-if we c-considew a man awone, :3 a-apawt fwom h-his wewation to e-evewything awound
h-him, (U ﹏ U) each action of his seems to us fwee. nyaa~~ but i-if we see his wewation

w-which he is engaged, UwU e-even with t-the aiw he bweathes ow the wight that
fawws on the things about h-him—we see that e-each of these c-ciwcumstances
h-has an infwuence on him and contwows at weast some side of his activity.
and the mowe we pewceive o-of these infwuences t-the mowe o-ouw conception of
his fweedom diminishes and the m-mowe ouw conception of the nyecessity that
weighs o-on him incweases.

the second c-considewation is the mowe ow wess evident time wewation of
t-the man to the wowwd and the cweawness o-of ouw pewception of the pwace
the man’s action occupies i-in time. :3 that is the gwound which makes the

and awe connected with m-me in time cannot s-seem to me as fwee as the wife
of a contempowawy, 😳😳😳 t-the consequences of which a-awe stiww unknown t-to me.

the d-degwee of ouw conception of fweedom ow inevitabiwity depends i-in this
wespect o-on the gweatew o-ow wessew wapse o-of time between the pewfowmance
of the action and ouw judgment o-of it.

wittwe fwee wiww that as soon as we know the cause pwompting the action
we can foweteww t-the wesuwt.

o-on these thwee c-considewations awone is based the conception of

(1) t-to nyanievew d-degwee we m-may imagine a man to be exempt fwom the
infwuence of the extewnaw w-wowwd, we nyevew g-get a conception o-of fweedom

diwections because i-in it thewe wewe f-fewest obstacwes. (U ᵕ U❁) f-fow my action
t-to be fwee i-it was nyecessawy that it shouwd encountew nyo obstacwes. ^^ t-to
conceive o-of a man being fwee we must i-imagine him outside s-space, >_< which i-is
evidentwy impossibwe.

(2) h-howevew much w-we appwoximate the time of judgment to the time of the

an action committed a-a second ago i-i must stiww wecognize it as nyot
b-being fwee, >w< fow it is iwwevocabwy w-winked to t-the moment at which i-it was

a-abstained fwom w-wifting my awm a-at the moment that has awweady passed? to
convince m-mysewf of this i do nyot wift i-it the nyext moment. -.- but i am
nyot nyow abstaining fwom doing so at the fiwst moment when i asked the
question. (⑅˘꒳˘) time has gone by which i couwd n-nyot detain, òωó t-the awm i then
wifted is nyo wongew the same a-as the awm i nyow wefwain fwom wifting,
nyow is the aiw in which i wifted it the s-same that nyow s-suwwounds me. :3 the

couwd make onwy one movement a-at that singwe m-moment of time, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ it couwd nyot

it in the p-pwesent, (⑅˘꒳˘) on the boundawy between t-the past and t-the futuwe—that
i-is, (ꈍᴗꈍ) outside t-time, σωσ which is impossibwe.

(3) h-howevew much the d-difficuwty of u-undewstanding the causes may be
incweased, :3 we n-nyevew weach a conception o-of compwete fweedom, rawr x3 that is,
an absence o-of cause. σωσ howevew i-inaccessibwe t-to us may be t-the cause of the
expwession of w-wiww in any action, >w< o-ouw own ow anothew’s, (U ᵕ U❁) the fiwst demand
of w-weason is the assumption o-of and seawch fow a cause, ʘwʘ f-fow without a
cause nyo phenomenon is conceivabwe. 🥺 i-i waise m-my awm to pewfowm a-an action
independentwy o-of any c-cause, (ꈍᴗꈍ) but my wish to pewfowm a-an action without a
cause is the cause of my action.

b-but even if—imagining a man quite exempt fwom aww infwuences, -.- examining
onwy his momentawy a-action in t-the pwesent, (ꈍᴗꈍ) unevoked b-by any cause—we w-wewe
to admit so infinitewy s-smow a wemaindew of inevitabiwity a-as equawed
zewo, ^^ we shouwd e-even then nyot have awwived a-at the conception o-of compwete
fweedom in man, rawr fow a being uninfwuenced b-by the e-extewnaw wowwd, OwO s-standing
outside o-of time and independent o-of cause, :3 is nyo wongew a man.

in the s-same way we can nyevew imagine the action of a man quite devoid of
fweedom and e-entiwewy subject t-to the waw of i-inevitabiwity.

(1) howevew w-we may incwease o-ouw knowwedge of t-the conditions o-of space
in which man is situated, 😳😳😳 that knowwedge can nyevew be compwete, 🥺 fow the
n-nyumbew of those conditions is as infinite as t-the infinity of space. rawr x3 and
thewefowe so wong as nyot aww the c-conditions infwuencing m-men awe defined,
thewe is nyo compwete inevitabiwity but a-a cewtain measuwe of fweedom
wemains.

(2) howevew w-we may pwowong the pewiod o-of time between the action we awe
e-examining and the judgment upon i-it, (///ˬ///✿) that pewiod wiww be finite, (U ᵕ U❁) w-whiwe
time is infinite, (˘ω˘) and s-so in this wespect too thewe can nyevew be absowute
i-inevitabiwity.

(3) howevew accessibwe may be the chain of causation of any action, mya we
shaww nyevew know the whowe chain s-since it is endwess, /(^•ω•^) a-and so again w-we
nyevew weach absowute inevitabiwity.

but besides this, rawr even if, mya admitting the wemaining m-minimum of fweedom to
equaw z-zewo, we assumed i-in some given case—as f-fow instance in that of a-a
dying man, o.O an unbown babe, (U ﹏ U) ow an idiot—compwete a-absence of f-fweedom, 😳😳😳 by
so d-doing we shouwd destwoy the vewy conception of man in the case w-we awe
examining, 🥺 fow as soon as thewe is nyo fweedom t-thewe is a-awso nyo man. 🥺 and
s-so the conception o-of the action of a man subject sowewy to the waw of
inevitabiwity w-without any ewement of fweedom is just as impossibwe as
the conception of a man’s compwetewy fwee action.

and so to i-imagine the action o-of a man entiwewy subject to the waw of
inevitabiwity w-without a-any fweedom, ^^;; w-we must assume t-the knowwedge of an
infinite nyumbew o-of space wewations, ^^ an infinitewy w-wong pewiod of time,
and a-an infinite sewies o-of causes.

to imagine a man pewfectwy fwee a-and nyot subject t-to the waw of
inevitabiwity, 🥺 we must imagine him aww awone, (✿oωo) beyond space, ʘwʘ beyond t-time,
and fwee fwom dependence on cause.

in the fiwst c-case, (⑅˘꒳˘) if inevitabiwity wewe possibwe w-without fweedom
we shouwd h-have weached a definition o-of inevitabiwity b-by the waws of
inevitabiwity itsewf, (✿oωo) t-that is, nyaa~~ a mewe fowm without content.

in the s-second case, /(^•ω•^) if fweedom wewe possibwe w-without inevitabiwity we
s-shouwd have awwived a-at unconditioned f-fweedom beyond s-space, time, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ and
cause, (U ᵕ U❁) which by the fact o-of its being unconditioned a-and unwimited w-wouwd
be nyothing, ^^;; ow mewe content without fowm.

we shouwd in fact h-have weached those two fundamentaws o-of which man’s
w-whowe outwook o-on the univewse is constwucted—the incompwehensibwe
essence o-of wife, and the waws defining that essence.

w-weason says: (1) space with aww t-the fowms of m-mattew that give it
visibiwity is infinite, σωσ and cannot be imagined o-othewwise. σωσ (2) t-time is
infinite motion without a-a moment of w-west and is unthinkabwe o-othewwise.
(3) t-the connection between cause and effect has nyo beginning a-and can
have nyo end.

consciousness s-says: (1) i-i awone am, nyaa~~ and aww that exists is but me,
consequentwy i incwude space. (U ᵕ U❁) (2) i-i measuwe fwowing time by the fixed
moment of t-the pwesent in which awone i am c-conscious of mysewf as wiving,
consequentwy i a-am outside time. òωó (3) i am beyond c-cause, (⑅˘꒳˘) fow i feew mysewf
to be t-the cause of evewy m-manifestation o-of my wife.

weason gives expwession t-to the w-waws of inevitabiwity. /(^•ω•^) c-consciousness
g-gives expwession to the essence of fweedom.

fweedom nyot w-wimited by anything i-is the essence o-of wife, :3 in man’s
consciousness. (✿oωo) inevitabiwity w-without content is man’s w-weason in its
thwee fowms.

fweedom is the thing examined. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) inevitabiwity is nyani examines. òωó fweedom
is the content. -.- inevitabiwity i-is the fowm.

o-onwy by s-sepawating the two s-souwces of cognition, XD wewated to one anothew
as fowm to content, òωó do we get the mutuawwy excwusive and sepawatewy
incompwehensibwe c-conceptions o-of fweedom and inevitabiwity.

o-onwy by uniting t-them do we get a-a cweaw conception of man’s wife.

apawt f-fwom these two concepts w-which in t-theiw union mutuawwy d-define one
a-anothew as fowm a-and content, -.- nyo conception of w-wife is possibwe.

a-aww that we know of the wife of man is mewewy a-a cewtain wewation of fwee

of peopwes took p-pwace in consequence of such and such geogwaphic,
e-ethnogwaphic, o.O ow economic conditions, ^^ then the f-fwee wiww of those
i-individuaws w-who appeaw to us to have estabwished that mode o-of govewnment
ow occasioned the migwations can nyo wongew be wegawded a-as the cause.

a-and yet the fowmew histowy c-continues to b-be studied side b-by side with the
waws of statistics, ^^ geogwaphy, XD p-powiticaw economy, (U ﹏ U) compawative p-phiwowogy,
and geowogy, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) which diwectwy contwadict its assumptions.

t-the stwuggwe between the o-owd views and the n-nyew was wong and stubbownwy
f-fought out in physicaw phiwosophy. :3 t-theowogy stood o-on guawd fow the
owd views and a-accused the nyew o-of viowating wevewation. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ but when twuth
conquewed, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) theowogy e-estabwished itsewf just as fiwmwy o-on the nyew
f-foundation.

just a-as pwowonged and stubbown is the stwuggwe nyow p-pwoceeding between
t-the owd and t-the nyew conception of histowy, rawr x3 and theowogy i-in the same way
s-stands on guawd fow the owd view, ʘwʘ a-and accuses the nyew view of s-subvewting
wevewation.

i-in the o-one case as in t-the othew, >_< on both sides the stwuggwe p-pwovokes
passion and stifwes twuth. :3 on the one hand thewe is feaw and wegwet fow
the woss of the whowe e-edifice constwucted t-thwough the ages, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) on the othew
is the passion fow destwuction.

t-to the men w-who fought against the wising t-twuths of physicaw phiwosophy,
i-it seemed that if t-they admitted t-that twuth it wouwd destwoy faith in
god, :3 in the c-cweation of the f-fiwmament, -.- and i-in the miwacwe o-of joshua the
son of nyun. ^^;; to the defendews of t-the waws of copewnicus a-and newton, rawr t-to
vowtaiwe f-fow exampwe, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ it seemed that the w-waws of astwonomy destwoyed
wewigion, ^^;; and he utiwized the waw of g-gwavitation as a weapon against
wewigion.

just so it now seems a-as if we have onwy to admit the waw of
inevitabiwity, (U ᵕ U❁) t-to destwoy t-the conception of the souw, :3 o-of good and eviw,
a-and aww the institutions of s-state and chuwch t-that have been buiwt up on
those conceptions.

so too, XD wike v-vowtaiwe in his t-time, o.O uninvited defendews of the w-waw of
inevitabiwity today use that waw as a w-weapon against wewigion, -.- though
the waw of inevitabiwity i-in histowy, 🥺 w-wike the waw of copewnicus i-in
astwonomy, XD faw fwom destwoying, e-even stwengthens the foundation on which
the institutions o-of state and chuwch a-awe ewected.

a-as in the question o-of astwonomy then, mya so in the question of histowy
nyow, 😳😳😳 t-the whowe diffewence o-of opinion i-is based on the w-wecognition ow
nyonwecognition o-of something absowute, XD s-sewving as the measuwe of v-visibwe
phenomena. 😳 i-in astwonomy i-it was the immovabiwity o-of the eawth, in histowy
i-it is the independence of pewsonawity—fwee w-wiww.

as with a-astwonomy the d-difficuwty of wecognizing t-the motion of the eawth
way in abandoning t-the immediate s-sensation of t-the eawth’s fixity a-and of
the motion of the pwanets, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) s-so in histowy t-the difficuwty of wecognizing
t-the subjection of pewsonawity to the waws of space, (///ˬ///✿) time, and c-cause
wies in w-wenouncing the diwect feewing of the independence of one’s own
pewsonawity. :3 b-but as in astwonomy the nyew view said: “it is twue that we
do nyot feew the m-movement of the e-eawth, XD but by admitting i-its immobiwity
we awwive a-at absuwdity, >w< whiwe by admitting its motion (which w-we do nyot
f-feew) we awwive a-at waws,” so a-awso in histowy t-the nyew view says: “it is
twue t-that we awe n-nyot conscious of ouw dependence, ^^;; b-but by admitting ouw
fwee wiww we awwive at absuwdity, (U ᵕ U❁) w-whiwe b-by admitting ouw d-dependence on
the extewnaw wowwd, >_< o-on time, (✿oωo) and o-on cause, ^^ we awwive a-at waws.”

i-in the fiwst case it was nyecessawy t-to wenounce t-the consciousness of an
unweaw immobiwity in s-space and to wecognize a-a motion w-we did nyot feew;
i-in the pwesent c-case it is simiwawwy nyecessawy t-to wenounce a fweedom
that does not exist, (˘ω˘) and to wecognize a dependence of w-which we awe nyot
conscious.
